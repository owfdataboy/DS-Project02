In his early youth, Peter's creativity was focused on drawing, painting and sculpting. His passion for music was inspired by the wide variety of sounds played at home by his music loving mother. His interest developed further when he encountered the electronic sounds of the late 80's and amongst his favourite artists and bands were Depeche Mode, New Order, Yello, Ultravox and also Michael Jackson.

At the beginning of the 90's the then 'unusual' style of techno captured his imagination and he realised that here was a sound he'd been searching for. The futuristic themes matched his interests in science fiction and the rhythmic structures of techno, unlike any other music before, made him feel like dancing. He was fascinated by all of the new, previously unheard sounds and was keen to understand how to create them.

Soon, he'd bought his own computer, learned about music programs and eagerly set about making his own music. After years of experimentation and a long search for his own sound, he made his first digital release on Sublogic Corporation, a digital record label. The positive reaction to the release, encouraged him to circulate a few demos and within 2 weeks he'd signed his first contract with Dj Misjah’s X-Trax Records.

In 2001 he released his first record; Sweets EP on X-trax under his guise Forcesupreme. His unique, bombastic and energetic style were highly appreciated by DJs like Marco Carola, Carl Cox and Adam Beyer. The even bigger follow-up ""Funkfragment EP"" ruled the DMC world charts for several weeks. After this Peter wanted to experiment more with sound and melody and started producing tech-house with heavy Detroit influences, which resulted in releases on X-Trax Sub (Mirage EP) and Tsunami Special Blend. 

Currently, Horrevorts has records released through X-trax, Tsunami, EC Records, Phonocult, Global Underground, Echoism and Kanzleramt and has remixed work from artists such as Ferry Corsten, The Timewriter, Secret Cinema, Dj Misjah, Michel De Hey, Dj Remy and Roland Klinkenberg. 2008 saw the release of his full length debut album ""EVOLVER"" on Kanzleramt Records which received massive support from artists from many different scenes. ""EVOLVER"" can be bought as CD, VINYL or Digital format from the Kanzleramt website or other online portals.  

Horrevorts has a number of great releases coming up for 2010, so keep your ears open!

His mission: exploring electronic music with a dub mindset. 

With an open mind and always in a search for fresh musical experiences, Gabriel Le Mar likes to integrate himself in different artistic constellations  with his dub-inspired TechHouse project Dublocation as well as with the artistic collaboration with Dr. Motte.

With his projects Saafi Brothers and Aural Float, Gabriel composed ambient, space and experimental sound scapes. With Aural Float he worked on audiovisual concepts: as a team they did the artistic supervision of SPACENIGHT, a prototype of a TV-concept, utilizing spectacular film- and documentary footage from outer space with music made on earth. SPACENIGHT became a success on german television and soon reached cult status among the young night watchers until today.

On his albums Gabriel produced tracks that are tailored for the dub inspired clubber, combining different playful approaches of Dub with the functionality and stringency of techhouse music. Bridges are built by energetic and minimal grooves.

Solo and with his projects Gabriel Le Mar appeared at festivals like Time Warp, Merkwürdiges Verhalten, Pollerwiesen, Fusion, Vision, Reworks, Roskilde, Sziget, Tribal Gathering, Fusion, Hadra, Ozora...

We can find his early tunes on Systematic, Azuli, Rise, Mo-Do, Serial Killer, Dak and many others. He is a quite versatile producer, making music on his own and with various partners.

With Spartaco Cortesi as Freaky Disco, and most recently with the swedish vocalist, producer, dj and model Elle A. Lorenzo and Elle have done many tracks together. Jet Set the first single was played and charted everywhere and grabbed the attention of many international Djs and labels. A second single followed and a full abum, Stop Thinking, which was licensed worldwide.

Lorenzo is also a good sound engineer, he has developed a wide experience running a recording studio for 5 years at Bini & Martini's label Ocean Trax. There he has produced various remixes and a number of hit tunes under different names such as Softminds – Breakaway, Johnny Price – Diamond Geeza, Audio Unit – Club Dj (with Gianni Bini) and Blake - Rock over You, Dirty Pitcher, Make Up EP and The Future EP. These records have been so succesfull making his name to be known worlwide and booked for gigs in China, Russia, Greece and UK at great parties such as Trailer Trash, Nodisko and Going Places in London.

In addition to these great experiences, in the last five years he has worked hard to launch his own record company excited by the new possibilities that the web is offering and using the expertise he has gained in music business. Eclectic Records was born, a platform for all the young, original, unsual electronic producers, to give them a chance to enter the music market and to explore new paths in marketing and communication. Many artist have been launched on Eclectic Records, Knuckles (now Sovnger), Mikix The Cat, EZLV, Lerio Corrado and most recently the american songwriter and producer Damian Daviid.

While the label is growing Lorenzo still plays live sets, mainly as Blake, bringing out 15 years of the finest electronic music, either with an old-skool vynil set or a futuristic ipad + laptop + video set. He plays a bit of everything, depending on the mood of the gig, from tech-house to trap music, from nu-disco to electronica."	388	165	0	42	22	3	2020-01-25T16:59:59Z	2008-01-29T11:08:29Z	False

Since his youth, he has been moved from various facets of electronic, ambient and techno music. He absorbed its pureness, discovering and facing the club experience, inciting himself to expand his studio and record collection, spontaneously becoming one of the main flags representing his nation within the electronic music branch.

Initially he begins djing along Emilia Romagna coast together with Sandro Russo and Kriss, estabilishing Undercut project, while at a later stage he went back to his motherland Brindisi. Limo is a solid performer with high familiarity in playing vinyls and using analog gears: his productions, dj sets and live performances transmit passion and attention to the user physical and sonorus engagement. Limo’s artistic attitude, translate into insistent grooves and caressing textures and led him to collaborate with relevant figures of the scene like Mike Dehnert, Alan Fitzpatrick, Patrick Skoog, Arnaud Le Texier, and also proposing his sound in cities like London, Berlin, Paris, Copenaghen, Amsterdam, Barcellona and many more.

The main project we can identify Limongelli with is the event series and electronic music label Transition LAB, started in 2008 when Apulia, Limo’s region, didn’t experience such underground nights yet: the project layed the foundations with the intent of being the main pole for house and techno culture, conveyed in parties and a vinyl label. Blawan, The Analogue Cops, Deadbeat, Agaric, Markus Suckut, Roman Lindau, Truncate, Inland and other excellent producers could collaborate with Transition LAB, nowadays a certainty in terms of music quality and event atmosphere. Apart from Transition LAB, Limo main musical activities include a new label ‘Coffee Pot’ founded in 2013 together with Guido Nemola plus performing constantly within Fachwerk Records european showcases, which features dates around Europe."	1664	340	0	26	3	15	2018-05-10T19:30:38Z	2008-01-30T20:05:31Z	False

Dj and producer, he has been practicing the activity in some prestigious italian clubs for twentyfive years. At the beginning of his career his programmings were oriented above all to funky and soul, musical kinds of which he boasts a collection of thousands of rare vinyl grooves. Subsequently, with the advent of house music, his passion for the deep and soulful sounds increased so much. These are the kinds which characterize his dj sets and productions, a mixture of deep house, soulful and latin vibes.

Music inspires in many ways, especially when your cosmos has revolved around black discs and shimmering Disco balls for nearly half an eternity. Crisder and DMS didn’t just yesterday fall for the groove of the diverse genres of electronic music. Since 1996 they have served as DJ’s of the night, who don’t simply pass on by, but instead remain a magical experience in the memories of their dancing audience. Up to now, important points along their musical journey haven’t only included clubs across the whole of Germany. They have also included appearances in Villa Bardzki and Aioula. Especially formative was their collective experience in Kollektiv 1..auditeur, which brought together many talented artists from Jena, Gera, Erfurt and the surrounding area, influencing the entire region’s sound. From all these experiences they have drawn the inspiration for their first collective tracks, which were cut from an overflowing tap of creativity and ideas, as well as their love for music- and not just in four-four time. In 2006 both artists decided not only create together as DJs but also to become active as a production team. As they began to work together under the name of Taron-Trekka the music scene began to pay attention, as they elegantly laid down deep beats, crackling sounds and purring melodies. Since then boundaries between Jena and Berlin have continued to be cleared, reshaped and broken in order to prove, with the help of new tracks, that this newly enlarged axis of music functions better and more productively then ever. The stylistic reach of Taron-Trekka’s music is too large for just one drawer. The groove moves at once so elegantly and fully, that you’ll feel you’ve discovered house music all over again. Before you know what’s hit you, the beat and rhythm will lead you to the grey zone which divides house and techno, and you’ll feel as if you were dreaming on the dancefloor. There are many ways to rediscover the beauty of slowness and to inspire yourself anew; among which the music of Taron-Trekka easily belongs.

Matthias Kunze had his first brush with house music long time ago, in his hometown Halle (Saale). Together with friends, he performed in several off-locations and started to gain interest in DJing. Currently he resides in Hamburg and plays clubs and festivals throughout Germany. The main source of his inspiration is Klangextase, a German podcast station he founded more than a decade ago. Through the years, Matthias has invited a lot of skilled artists across the world to share their music on the platform. In 2018, he went from local to global and ventured out to South Africa where he has played in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Matthias’ sound describes as deep, sometimes melancholic, combined with subtle highlights and a kicking beat, which makes everyone move. His musical journeys are always good for a surprise and leave the audience with a feeling of joy."	5439	499	0	785	797	6	2021-05-05T16:07:25Z	2008-03-14T19:43:46Z	False

Swedish jazz pioneer Nils Berg is one of the most influential voices in nordic jazz. With his quartet, The Stoner, he has made a name for himself both in Sweden and internationally, and in 2007 he received the prestigious Jazz-in- Sweden-award.. As a composer he won’t dodge projects that cross over conventional borders - collaborations with electronica artist Forss and choreographer Dorte Olesen to name a couple. His trio Nils Berg Cinemascope is a prime example of this, fusing jazz together with video clips of musicians from all over the globe gathered from YouTube.

Toti is sure one of the most interesting artists of the night club, extremely various, able to give power to the dancefloor or cooling pulling it outside “the more dark” side of the techno, developing his tracks through a precious analogic base and powerful bassline........

Music was always a big part of the Dale family's life......Soul, Reggae, Jazz and Funk.....even before Colin left school friends included Fabio, Grooverider, Dave Angel, Jumping Jack Frost and Bryan Gee........all who went on to be top Djs in their respective scenes. It all began in 1982 when Colin who was then working as a banker in the city of London began to warm up for Hip Hop supremo ""Tim Westwood"" at the cult Gossips nightclub in Soho playing cuts like Soul Sonic Force, Strafe, Shannon and Donna Summer. 

In 1985 Colin was one of the key members of the pirate radio station Kiss FM and soon after left banking to pursue a career in music and the ""Abstrakt Dance"" radio show was born. For 16 years ""Abstrakt Dance"" was a ground-breaking show which quite simply bought Techno to the masses. Guests on the show included All the UR crew, Hawtin, Angel,  Pullen, Garnier,  Saunderson, Craig, May, Cox......the list goes on and .. the show was put on the internet in 1993 Colin became a household name in Techno circles Worldwide. It was the first ever Techno show to be transmitted live with visuals on the internet and it was revolutionary. It was around this time that Colin teamed up with Brenda Russell and Colin Faver to do the 'Knowledge' 'Deep Space' & Submerge series of club nights in London which again saw the team take London's Techno scene to new highs. Other club nights that Colin has been involved in include Electric Boogie, Vapour Space, Deep and Jelly. Production wise Colin has recorded for Perfecto on their very first LP, Obsessive, Logic, Sensei, Visitor, Abstrakt Dance, Swag, Laus and Alien Funk amongst others as well as 7 well received mix compilation LPs for various major record labels. (see discography*) As well as being a regular guest at clubs such as Fabric, Rex, Pasha (Buenos Aires) and Love (Brazil) Colin has toured the Worlds clubs extensively.....Japan, China, Russia, Australia and Eastern Europe, U.S.A.........Colin is a favourite the World over. Looking back Colin has played some of the World’s best parties.....Dance Valley, Full Moon, Tribal Gathering, Sunrise, Dance Valley, Energy, Love Parade, Automatik @ Rex Club Paris, Rage @ Heaven, Bloc Festival, Glade, Dragon Ball and recently special guest at Paul Van Dyke’s Vandit club in Berlin.
 
Fast forward to 2013 and its all systems go...there’s the label “Abstrakt Dance” with Jules Dickens record label and web-site due in January, regular sets @ Fabric, Boom Boom Room, The Whitehouse, House Of Honey, East Village, Jamm and The Egg club in London and also more Wildlife AM and D.S.T.P Warehouse parties which have been taking London’s club-land  by storm.
There’s also lot’s of hot new music as well from labels such as Plastic City, Abstrakt Dance, Influential House and Evasive record labels amongst others as well as a heavy remix schedule. There also a sample / loop CD coming out on Monstersounds / Loopmasters released December 2012.

These days Colin musically is all about Tech, Minimal and Electro House with occasional injections of classics from the past........check out his latest mixes and tracks right here on Soundcloud.

Since our beginnings as a net-label in 2005 we have featured artists from across the world on numerous recordings released digitally and on CD and vinyl. While focussing predominantly on crossover ambient styles, we try not to limit ourselves to any one genre. Listening to our music is the best way to get to know us!

Our music is frequently used in TV and film productions, regularly receives international radio airplay and has been featured in several highly regarded printed publications and online magazines. We're extremely lucky to have a loyal and exacting fan base, many of whom have been following our output since day one.

Our aim since then has remained the same, to call attention to music that we think is deserving of your time. We're excited by advancements in technology and how they can facilitate new ways to enjoy music and video. In 2005 we were distributing music digitally in MP3 format before it was seen as a financial opportunity by the music industry at large. We love the internet for the creative freedom it allows and the connections it's helped us make.

The name Serein was taken from a meteorological dictionary, it is used to describe 'fine rain falling from a clear sky after sunset'. We pronounce it seh-rain, you can say it however you want.

Dave's musical endeavors kicked off in the 80' as the drummer for legendary H/C Punk band Discharge (check back of the first Metallica album)…Later he switched to guitar, recording an album for the infamous Earache imprint...After this recording he became immersed in the new electronic soundz from Detroit & Chicago that were infiltrating the UK, and found inspiration from the productions of Maurizio & Basic Channel…

Today, he continues pushing forward and finds his productions/remixes appearing on: Supplement Facts, Rekids, 100% Pure, Connaisseur, Kanzleramt, Intacto, Remote Area, Cocoon...

He brings with him a DJ fan base that stretches globally from current top draw DJ’s through to established oldskool titan’s; Jeff Mills, DJ Rush…etc to Giles Petterson & Michael Reinboth…

Together with 2000 and One, Dave penned the massive summer 06 hit Pecan...Other hits include Standing In Line & Today Tomorrow and Yesterday…Tracks have appeared on compilations: Ministry of Sound, Global Underground, FUSE, Kontor,...

His DJ & Live act has seen him perform at major festivals: Awakenings, Welcome to the Future, Sensation, Tomorrowland & Mysterland…

Never afraid to take on fresh ideas and innovations, Dave constantly surprizes us…As dance music shifts & changes he keeps on top and adapts, but still roots his productions in quality & originality...His output has become renowned for it’s pumpin rhythmic style & melodic hook lines...Tracks can be both smooth & dreamy, or dark & poundin (often at the same time).... He can switch styles as only a bona fide musician can, but what set's him apart, is the innate ability to combine in his sound double dose rawness with fookin elegance!!!

Their roots crawl upon manyn musical genres, from Metal sounds to futuristic and violent EBM: the first weapon of mass destruction was in their hands when they self-produced ""Albedo Level: 0%"", a 4 tracks long killer mix of industrial decadence, deep space sounds and corroding hellectrowaves feasting under a grey velcro sky, among acid smokes and toxic clouds: morbid and screaming vocals meets lasergun massacre guitars and cold martial beats, adding lyrics concerning rusty landscapes, xenothropic invasions in sci-fi and horror movies style, future destruction and the Mind Body Problem, orchestrated in the key of Fear.

The, the new Era came.

After some remix exchanges with EBM and Industrial Metal acts like Unter Null, Syrian, Dope Stars Inc and XP8, the five aliens released te EP which is the consacration of their unique & innovative sound: ""The Dancefl-horror: NASA vs INRI"", nine tracks of electronic and metal suppuration, followed by a new web-single, ""Abduction Starfleet"", a brand new song, which demonstrate another step to their definitive evolution and maturity; a fresh combination which is defined by the most as a perfect mix of two different and contrasting genres.

Stands to you now, humans: dance until you die or make a unbridled headbanging, to the violent and catchy sound of your self-destruction."	166	7	0	2	1	3	2018-11-13T16:04:49Z	2008-03-21T16:41:06Z	False

Preso il diploma, Elena scappa a Ibiza con la sua migliore amica per quello che sarà un viaggio rivelatore: sulla isla blanca scopre il DJing e la sua irresistibile forze di comunicazione. Appena rientra in patria inizia ad imparare e a studiare i modi più efficaci per trasmettere e condividere le sue emozioni attraverso l'uso della consolle.
Cultura di strada ed innovazione sono i suoi termini preferiti.
Grandissima fan dello sviluppo, sostiene tutte le nuove tecnologie destinate ad enfatizzare e sviluppare in modo creativo le prestazioni dei suoi djset, questi per lei non sono solo intrattenimento ma un vero e proprio modo con la quale esprime il suo sentire alla pista.
La musica che suona rappresenta per lei un unione sociale capace di abbattere le differenze di confini, di razze e di sesso.

Emma circumvents the machine eventually, destroys it and leaves ""The House that Jack built"" in her fancy leather dress. Add Noise could have been the evil programmer for sure, but he never would have done such a thing. Add Noise loves machines.  
                            
                            If you are looking for delicate melodies, for harmonic euphoria, go look somewhere else. Add Noise is about dry and raw energy, driven by an unprecedented love for funk-fueled percussion massacres. Energy deriving directly from all kinds of machines easily as old as Emma Peel's enemy. Old circuitry knows how to boogie and Add Noise makes sure it does.

After studying, he used to turn on the radio, mostly to listen to Techno-Progressive music programs. His attraction to the dancefloor made him stand among the first voice-artists in the TECHNO scene of Puglia. But his real love for the electronic sound took place in 1996 when, thanks to his uncle, who was a sound technician and a producer, he discovered the world of composition through ""COMPUTER MUSIC"".In 2003 he got a degree in ""SOUND TECHNICIAN AND REGISTRATION EXPERT"" at the APM (CN) where he refined his techniques for his deep-seated passion. In 2005 he worked for a rmx  of VEGETABLE G ""A PERFECT SPRINGS"" (Olivia records,Minus Habens) unreleased.In 2006 became a part of THE FLAME RECORDINGS label,a well-known tag in Puglia.IN 2008 he founded SoundSET project where dj are associated with high class musician for a deeper JAM SESSION,actually he his working for a first live with pianist and clarinet player.
His Techno and House background wonders and gets in touch with the deepest roots of contemporary music, lyrical and jazz passing through old school's hip-hop.

He played the area´s hip hop parties, then having moved to house music along the way, held residencies in Geneva clubs that brought the main American and European house DJs to the city in the nineties. Naturally, Sir George became fully involved in production, catching the ear of NYC´s Chez Music house record label in the late nineties. Largely using live instrumental parts, Sir George´s first release « Don´t move » became an underground hit within the US house scene, its remix pack also charting very well. Sir George has produced half a dozen records, also releasing on the German techno-house label Trax Of Interest.

BIO

D Lewis, born on April 17th in 1973, started playing electronic music in several clubs as soon as he came of age and, at the same time, he began approaching to some discographic productions. In early 90’s he met dj Emix with whom he started a long collaboration that will bring them to produce more than fifty “vinyl records”. In 1999 he took part to a course for “sound engeneer” in Milan and the following year he gave birth to his own “recording studio” called “Locomotore Recording Studio” based in Rome. After his collaboration with many different labels, he carried out the Off’s Electrica salsa’s remix in 2004, produced by Joe T Vannelli for Clubbin’ Records , appreciated and played by many international dj’s, followed by Venusville, Push it, Belladonna feat. Vladimir Luxuria, Back to acid, Gomma, Fuck, John Dahlback’s remix “If you give me” and many others…“Scariche”, one of his most known and famous records, brought him to a close collaboration with Claudio Donato’s Antibemusic Records Company to which belong Acid 80’, Zig Zag, Abm, Mr. Disc, Sound Real and Fulltime Records. In 2007 he published his first album, “Officine Romane”, together with Emix, distributed in Italy, France, Switzerland, Spain, Russia and broadcasted in Germany by “Zyx Records”, followed by the video “Baby”, the first single to come out and showed by the main tv-radio’s stations. Together with Emix he gave birth to a discographic project titled “Audiosafe” trying to search for new sounds. At the same time, he started performing at several prestigious clubs such as: Red Zone (Pg), Madame Butterfly (Fe), Alcatraz (Mi), Rolling Stone (Mi), Magazzini Generali (Mi), Pacha (Palma de Mallorca), Space (Valencia), Bcm (Palma de Mallorca), Divinae Folliae (Bisceglie), Peter Pan ( Riccione), Canniccia Club ( Versilia) and as resident-dj at Palladium (Rome), Cyborg (Tr), Arabesk (Vt), Nrg (Rome), Muccassassina ( Rome), Cocoricò (Rn), Area Mito (Ss) and at Space (Ibiza) on summer 2007.From 2003 he is resident-dj at “Diabolika International Party”, the famous “party-event” that brought him around the entire peninsula and in Europe and also on a “Live radio show” every Saturday on M2O. In 2008 he realized with Emix a “one-night show”, titled “Reazione”, exclusively once a month from Cocoricò (Riccione) and from Nrg (Rome). In the same year he began writing (monthly) for a magazine “Maxim” (nightlife/djblog). In 2009 he was resident with Benny Benassi at Diabolika Summer Edition at Cocorico.In 2011 he was resident at Cocorico Love Aquafan with Cirillo and in 2012 began his collaboration with Supersonic Events at Atlantico (Rome) and he played at SounDrome International Festival at Olympic Stadium (Rome), and Spazio 900, the best Club in Rome.
He worked with the best dj's such like Deadmau5, Boys Noize, Joris Voorn, Trentemoller, Crookers, Bloody Beetrots, Benny Benassi, 2 Many Djs, Eric Morillo, Roger Sancez, Tiesto, Fedde Le Grand, Congorock and many moore...and his sound is highly valued by experts.

D Lewis is a very special and quite “different” dj on the scene; his passion for music, his musical culture and his technical preparation and knowledge let himself realize some very unique “sets”.

With recent releases on labels like EXILE, Figure and Drumcode, Mikael has earned the support and attention from all the key players in the techno scene, resulting in a busy schedule of gigs around the world. His latest stops included the legendary Berghain in Berlin, Lehmann in Stuttgart, Privilege on Ibiza, Dockyard Festival during ADE in Amsterdam or Lantern in Bejing.

Starting out as a drummer in early years, attending municipal music education, led to the later interest in electronic music. Being a part of the Swedish rave culture in the late 90´s, Mikael started to collect pretty much every analogue synthesizer he could afford. What started out as experimental sounds evolved and matured over the years into music, and back in 1999 Mikael´s first vinyl record was released. Hard struggle in the studio and behind the decks, in combination with being a highly sought after producer in the international techno-scene has resulted in a variety of high quality releases topping the techno charts over a significant period of time.

In 2016 Mikael decided to team up with Johannes Heil, Markus Suckut and Andre Kronert as part of the EXILE imprint. Over the next years we will see a steady flow of releases and label events connected to these four producers and their mutual virtues and values that reach far beyond the music and the bussiness of the electronic music scene.

Right now Mikael continues to build his own intricate sound, characterised by an unique sound design and his attention to details. Strongly supported by fans, radio-stations and DJs around the globe, Mikael´s journey continues. Artistry through techno, 2018 style."""	6868	1	0	2	27	0	2018-01-30T15:27:25Z	2008-03-31T10:29:44Z	False

Since it's fireside conception in 2007, Hobotech has steadily grown in popularity, with Jon's recent schedule including an appearance at Coachella, an opening set for Bassnectar with collaborator Haj (Sub Swara), and shows which have found him sharing the stage with luminaries of bass music including ill.Gates, David Starfire and AN-TEN-NAE. 
The EP ""This Is The Place"" was described as ""like George Clinton meets Datsik"" on <a href=""http://BassGeneration.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BassGeneration.com</a>, and was included as a featured download in the 2010 wrapup newsletter from <a href=""http://TheUntz.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheUntz.com</a>.<p></p><p>
Hobotech is the sound of ozark mountain futurefunk, dirty electro gospel, and glitched out whomp crashing into delta blues. Hobotech is a place where Tom Waits wreck subwoofers and Ralph Stanley gets his crunk on. It's contemporary music that nods to a forgotten America, celebrating half-smoked cigars and railside cauldrons of stew.</p><p></p><p>
Jon is the author of Ableton Live Power!, co-author of Your Ableton Live Studio with Chris Buono, and has written numerous articles for Music Tech magazine. He presents classes and workshops around the country, teaches for cutting-edge music school Dubspot and is an Adjunct Instructor at New York University.

400	Positive Flow	Jesse	Reuben Wilson	Jesse Reuben Wilson	UK	https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-ssCHOnzfg7lBFRvq-eCucvg-large.jpg	4	24	"Positive Flow is the brainchild of UK-based multi-instrumentalist producer Jesse Reuben Wilson.

With parents that played music loud to him as he went off to sleep as a baby (so he wouldn’t be woken when they had parties) you could say his musical education started young. His guitarist father played in folk clubs alongside legends like the late John Martyn and brought him up on a wide-ranging musical diet from Steely Dan to Billy Cobham.

Starting out aged 3 with chopsticks and plastic topped tubs for drums Jesse swiftly moved up to a miniature drum kit aged seven, learnt how to play his Dad’s guitar and self-taught himself piano – by his early teens he was a multi-instrumentalist. Then armed with a Tascam 4-track tape recorder, a classic Juno-60 and a TR909 (bought in a classified ad for £75) – the world of “overdubbing” had been discovered.

He grew up through the original phase of electro and hip hop and would regularly spend Saturday afternoons in Canterbury, Kent “popping and breaking” to Streetsounds “Electro” albums with school best-friend – legendary soul star Omar. Having become obsessed with “the recording process” he made sure his week of school “work experience” was spent at a local recording studio and saved enough pocket money to record his first demo there with a Linndrum and Juno 106. At a later date he did a recording course at Goldsmiths College, London.

Having crafted his art the next decade went on to see him release numerous recordings under various project names from Ultravibe to Stratospheric for labels such as Universal, Om Records, Hed Kandi, Shanachie, Internal Bass and more. He has also had music used in various TV shows like ‘Bones’ and ‘Grand Prix’.

Due to that broad musical diet Jesse has never been content with sticking strongly to just one musical genre and whenever he gets the itch he’ll jump from soul to electronica to house to Brazilian to jazz to folk and beyond … “If it’s deep, if it’s quality – I’ll likely be into it. DJ sets and personal listening vary a great deal but generally I always fall back to some form of deep soul and a jazz chord.”

Although working on numerous projects, Positive Flow has become Jesse’s main vehicle and has won critical acclaim and rotation from all the heavy-hitters like Gilles Peterson, Michael Rütten, Rainer Trüby, MCDE, Laurent Garnier and more…

“Flow Lines”, his debut album for TDR dropping late 2012, features an array of talent in the vocal arena from British soul supremo and old school friend Omar to Stacy Epps, Colonel Red, Andre Espeut, Vanessa Freeman, Heidi Vogel (Cinematic Orchestra) and more.

From the soul-laden future club classic “Do What I Do” through the brokenbeat Azymuth tinged “Orange & Brown” out to the epic deep spiritual offerings of “Universal Truth” – “Flow Lines” is a rich tapestry of organic electronica interwoven with real strings – a hallmark of classic LPs."	3812	266	0	117	248	9	2020-07-11T17:38:07Z	2007-10-13T11:37:00Z	False

They met during a 'nightflight' in a Viennese bar and found they had many musical similarities. The emerging fusion marked the beginning of many Club sessions, which, in cooperation with several guest performers, had the audience dancing wildly.

The wonderful mixture between Jesse's longstanding live jazz experience as a vocalist and Gerald's exquisite choice of sound and musical background as DJ and guitarist made the duo an insider tip within the Viennese Club Scene.

While Jesse, gained recognition with his former group 'Reposado' and current formation 'Now Pfow b.d.d.', Gerald co-produced several tracks with 'Freedom Satellite', a band from the 'Vienna Scientists Recordings' collective.

Boogiewood's sounds range from jazzy hip-hop beats, groove/funk breaks, downbeat to latin/brasil house with influences by the early jazz/latin/funk scene of the 50-70s.

The Morning Show
“One the best and biggest surprises for me this year was The New Law’s releases…beautiful, emotional, cinematic…  .Its near perfect”
The Stranger Review
Dave Segal – The Stranger
“Adam Straney and Justin Neff—produce deftly arranged, orchestrally inclined hiphop that evokes Ninja Tune’s glory years and Portishead’s doomed-romance aura (sans Beth Gibbons’s ruined croons, obviously). Hints of J Dilla’s clipped, staccato beatmaking also color the New Law’s tracks, which often demonstrate a cinematic scope and keenly emotive sense of atmosphere. URB picked them for its Next 1,000 Artists feature, and damn if the L.A.-based mag isn’t on point with that choice.”
URB Mag Review
URB magazine / URB.com (selected THE NEW LAW as Top Next 1,000 Artists)
“It’s refreshing to find a talented new ambient electronic artist. This duo is versatile as can be. They’ve been toiling in the Seattle underground for three years, now finally preparing to release their sophomore album. From the surreal saxophone of “Seattle Lights” to the foreboding death march of “Hell’s Gates,” they paint pictures with sound. Ambient is a word that’s thrown around a lot. The New Law has proven that they know the meaning.”
80bpm.net Review
Kaska Paluch (editor-in-chief – www.80bpm.net)
“The New Law is one of the best albums from underground I’ve ever gotten.”
Properly Chilled’s Ethan Georgi Review

“If you remember the movie HARDWARE, the album cover might get you thinking of a sort of Bladerunner apocalypse sound. You might be right, but The New Law is way better than such a simplification. Really nice work!”

With both inspiration and motivation, he said good-bye to his friends and family in Washington, DC in 2004 and made the 5000-mile move to Berlin. With his laptop, music, and purpose in mind; Aaron knew that is where he had to be if he wanted things to happen.
Aaron started his own label, District of Corruption in 2002 with a bang. His track, “Watching Me”, was licensed by Jeff Mills for his “Exhibitionist” dj/live audio/visual project. Aaron has played all across Berlin in Panorama Bar/Berghain, Maria, Pfefferbank, Kinzo, Arena, Ballhaus Ost/Im, Bar25, Chalet, Katerholzig and Club der Visionare. He’s also played in other internation locations such as Paris, London, and Cape Town. After over a decade of label management, he decided to focus more on his first love - music composition and performance.
The last year of covid shutdown has been a year for introspection. Rather than succumbing to boredom it was time to level up his production and music composition skills with online courses. With a forthcoming release on Traum Schallplatten and many other music projects in the works 2021 looks to be an exciting year!"	1653	645	0	900	110	45	2021-06-14T19:37:35Z	2007-10-24T15:20:00Z	False

Sven Jozwiak’s fascination for electronic music grew from a close affinity to Berlin’s lively electro scene. Years of clubbing, dancing and listening to what the city had on offer lead to an urge to participate himself. He wanted to become a DJ, so he bought some turntables at the age of 22 and began his career in the MOMA summer of 2006 after spontaneously taking over the decks at one of the many legendary Berlin afterhours. It worked out and his passion for DJing had been awakened.

He was able to improve his skills through playing at parties like Klangspiel and the famous Berlin HOMESWEETHOME, as well as at other events organized by the KASSETTE label. Soon just playing music wasn’t enough anymore and so he started to produce his own tracks. Two years later in 2008 his first track, recorded in cooperation with Tassielo Ippenberger (Pan-Pot), was published at 60SEC RECORDS. Tracks at labels like KASSETTE Rec, QT RECORDS, UPON YOU, Arera Sur and K:lender then followed and today he can now look back on an impressive discography. In the meantime his Djing brought him to legendary clubs such as Bar25, Kater Holzig and arenaclub as well as to festivals such as MELT!, with each performance enabling him to improve his skills continuously. 

When Sven takes to the turntables he enchants the audience with his mixture of house, tech-house and minimal vocal techno. The percussive, slightly melancholic and often playful sound takes control of Berlin’s dance floors and his feeling for beats and atmosphere is as impressive as his lively, passionate and beguiling performances. But he never loses sight of his goals. His favorite clubs are those with low ceilings that the audience can actually touch and thus provide an intimate and inspirational energy to his sets. Such an atmosphere inspires him to completely submerge himself into his DJ set. Then he doesn’t just play the tracks, he lives them. Sven about Sven: „DJing is the best, most fantastic, greatest thing. If all are dancing, kissing, just being happy and satisfied, having fun and simply enjoying the feeling of freedom, I am happy too.” 
He finds great enrichment within his musical work through close cooperation with other DJs and musicians. At the height of the Berlin electro scene’s “minimal” hype he met Mert. Sven and Mert complement each other perfectly and they have been producing and experimenting with music since 2008. Together they are searching for one language to realize their vision of grooving dance floors in a certain special way. Their tracks are characterized by drifting, dynamic sounds in both the sparkling highs and the majestic solid bass depths. 
During a summer at Bar25, Sven found himself playing a DJing marathon set together with Empro. The congenial project  „Empro & Jozwiak“ went on to publish several tracks in 2010. Tracks from an upcoming project with Jan Fuchsberg will be published under the working name “Sven Jozwiak & Fuchsberg“.

She has dedicated much time and study to both jewish music and all kinds of popular genres from jazz to electronic music. She lived in Hungary, Germany, Israel and in the Netherlands, but she also visited the US for further studies of spiritual music. 

Today she mixes world music with rap and jazzy sound in projects like “Hagesher” or “Zuboly”. She also worked with the Dj-pair “Savages y Suefo” recording liturgical text on electronic beat. 
Her band “Shkayach” - playing traditional jewish music in the past - transformed a few years after she returned from her studies in Berlin into the more free fusional Jazz-Klez project “Flora Polnauer And The Promised Band”.
She was singer of funky-hiphop band “Planet55” and she worked featuring “Hippikiller” in a couple of songs.
In 2016, inspired by Marlene Dietrich, she came out with “Marlene Reload” that she co-produced with Balázs Bihari (HippiKiller) and Zsolt Prieger (Anima Sound System).
Because of her love for the theatre she took part in many dance and theatre projects, in all kinds of roles.

Today she is a practising cantor both in Hungary and abroad, but she is also eager to widen her horizon when it comes to music, to open up to many genres, and to actually play with them…"	197	118	0	5	3	1	2017-04-08T01:37:11Z	2007-10-30T11:05:33Z	False

Music is a question of taste, but you can expect some quality things here productionwise - normalized in frequency spectrum and loudness, ready for DJ use.

My tracks are uploaded as hi-fi variable bitrate MP3s. VBR is roughly equivalent to 256 bps. 320 is pointless, as a 44.1kHz/16bit file will mathematically never use more than 256. Funny how everyone on soundcloud seems to think 320 is good. In any case, MP3 will always mean a certain amount of loss, so the only way to avoid that is to use WAV/AIFF/FLAC or RAR. In professional productions you should never employ MP3, no matter how high the bitrate.

Old skool Nemo has spent the last 30 years in the jazz record racks going from soul to funk to breakbeat and hip hop, from drum n’ bass to electro. Brought up on psychedelic rock and jazz, between Montréal, Paris and Brittany , he launched himself into the vast world of Electronic music in the beginning of the 90's with Hip Hop, Dub and Drum and Bass. But it was towards the Breakbeat scene from England and San Francisco that Old Skool Nemo turned his mixes and attention at the end of the 90’S. He launched his first label in 1999 and started to support and produce many french and english artist. As a ""musical globetrotter"" he plays now for 20 years in many club and festival and being Producer, Promoter, Dj and Musician, he presents a ""psychedelic"" cross over of soul, funk, Indie Dance, cosmic disco and House with classical tracks, re-edit and amazing remix.

Game music, too, but that's mostly work. I like to do my homework, myself.



Also sometime producer of <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/panssarijuna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Panssarijuna</a>.  Fun, in Finnish!


<b><i>All right YEAH YEAH. WHAT ARE THESE?</i></b>

<b>THE CHIP</b> is just me fucking about with 80s tv cop themes. Hey, I calls them as I does themses.

<b>OUR SEASIDE ESCAPE</b> is a bunch of soundtrack-type songs (or sketches, if you want to be a dick about it :D ) that I've been working on lately. They're not for any specific small-town murder mystery serial, in fact they're not for anything. But for your enjoyment, that is. Hmm.

<b>PROPHECIES</b> collects all kinds of drones and ambiences. Like, ambient, you know, music for, I dunno, dystopian homes and farms? Or short films about love and loss in the time of silurians? Dunno, I just ... do this stuff.
ok, that's the <i>unreleased</i> latest stuff mostly dealt with, what about the rest? 

<b>FUTURE RUINS</b> is my latest album, out in iTunes, BeatPort, Spotify etc., it's pretty much Space Ambient – but I like to think it's the <i>good kind</i>. Lots of found sound, droning drones and old-fashioned melody things, quite a bit of sound design hidden in there, too. Check it out.

<b>BOXY MUSIC</b>, is a bunch of small melody vignettes. Because making my next Big Albums (more on those later) started feeling like<i> work</i>, them being densely layered and processed, I started relaxing by doing little melodies during workday and evenings. Boxy is the result, simple childish melodies for young listeners. Not bad for working on your coloring book! <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buy</a> it or just listen to it here, neither way breaks my bank.

<b>THE CAVE</b> is my neo-non-classical (or Bad Ambient, I dunno) diversion. it's far from easy listening. I got myself a bow and mallets and started bowing stuff, decided that making a minimal <i>cave exploration turned sci-fi </i>-soundtrack sounds like fun. It has been, for me, you can make up your own mind. You can buy it on <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>. If you do, I promise to waste all your money on Etsy stuff.

<b>FUTURE CITIES</b> is my forthcoming opus :D It was <i>supposed</i> to be a little record about the future that science once promised us, like eight songs. Don't let anybody tell me that I have problems sticking to my plans, ok? <i>After having released the first third in Future Ruins (up there)</i> I'm left with these two full-length albums, Cities and 

<b>FUTURE DREAMS</b> is the brightest timeline, the warmest of the Future records. If someone decides to publish them or I start to care.

Then there's Tea For Miss Yamaha (2001), my 300+ gram vinyl downtempo steal... I mean, sample-fest. Still very much loved among lovers of such things.

After that, I did some ambient albums and fun beats. You can guess which LP:s are which, they're all in my sets.

You can find almost all the previous albums for free here or on the <a href=""http://www.polyfonken.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. Except the Zen Bound soundtracks, you have to go to <a href=""http://zenbound.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">zenbound.com</a> for those.

______________________________

Half Dutch, Half Egyptian, and based in Geneva, Hendrik van Boetzelaer has established himself as a key player of the Swiss scene. He is known for his passion for warm and forward thinking music for the body regardless of the genre. Following years of activism as Opuswerk, his first work under his real name, the “Mémoire Du Présent EP”, on François X’s Dement3dXXX, reveals an artist’s coming of age in continuity of his past work.
Trained as an architect, and passionate by the concept of “the club”, he thrives for what triggers raw emotions. Maturing from years of self-education, spawned with dub and drum and bass sound systems, he plays and makes music that is both adventurous and inventive with a defined futuristic aesthetic and firmly grounded in the experience of one’s body on the dancefloor. It’s as if he found his sound as much as it found him, delving inspirations from the wide spectrum of what dance music has to offer: House, Techno, EBM, Electro, IDM, Balearics, old and new.
His approach to producing, both visceral and highly technical have gotten him to team with artists like François X for the HISS:1292 project or Ripperton for the Aelectricitae Live project. As Hendrik van Boetzelear his work has reached a new plateau of explorations where he channels his many cultural origins into freeform experimentations. As a testimony to his never ending hunger for knowledge, and representative of his research process, his previous work using the Opuswerk pseudonym, came out on labels such as Bleed Music, Semantica, ARTS or Dement3d. As Hendrik van Boetzelaer, he has shed his skin and dropped the moniker.
His style is always forward thinking and finds adventurous ways of transporting the dancers beyond the boundaries of the club all the while challenging them. His musical consistency, brings him to play, in the best clubs and festivals from Concrete to Tresor or Mute, CTM Festival and Montreux Jazz or Paleo.

I started DJ'ing in 1990 in Munich with Garage House, NY Style, changed later to Chicago House and ended up with Detroit Techno (1994) but decided to play “Freestyle” very early (1996) as I got bored of playing the same kind of music all night long. In the 90ies I played a lot of gigs all over Europe along all the big names at this time. Even Tony Humphries, Jeff Mills, Colin Faver, DJ Hell. In Clubs like Tresor Berlin, E-Werk Berlin, Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen, Flex inVienna, Raves in Italy, small and big Festivals and many many more. 
1997 I moved to Hamburg where I started a monthyl club night called Club Neu at Club Tempelhof. There we played a really cool freestyle programm, from Hip-Hop to Djungle, from Electro via Disco to House or Beatz. And the crowd there was really cool. They danced to everything we ""served"". 
I also organized there a really cool night with Cheap Records from Vienna meets Clear Records (Matthew Herbert) or the huge DJ Hell at Rote Flora event. Somtimes I had a chance to play the famour Pudel Club which was also big fun!

In 1999 I moved to Berlin where I started ""Support Your Local Ghetto"" which was  the name of my weekly Radio Show on Twen.FM a pirate radio here in Berlin. I had a lot of fun playing my fave tunes plus having guests from all over the world. Mostly my guests where just from the neighborhood.  I love my hood. There are so many talented artists which have to be heard. So, lets stay local. But local not only in the meaning of territory, local means also all the friends and people you have in your neighborhood. Will never forget the outstanding show with Blake Baxter and Abe Duque or with the Stones Throw Dudes.  Some recordings of this shows must still be in the interwebs. Will try to find and publish them here. 

In 2011 I reactived the ""support your local ghetto"" This time at the lovely Panke in Berlin Wedding as a monthly club night. Every last friday of the month. This event I did for 3 years until April 2014. 

Work in Music: 
I started working in the music – biz also very early - in the very early 90ies in Munich where I started the booking agency around the Label Disko B and the Club Ultraschall. (Artists: DJ Hell, Blake Baxter, Abe Duque, Patrick Pulsinger and many more).

In ’96 a major label called and I moved to Hamburg to promote great artists like: Goldie, Roni Size, Money Mark, Portishead etc… Parallel I had a weekly residency at Club Tempelhof, where I played my “Freestyle” program. Of course way too early, so after 1 year it was done. After my experience with a Major Label I did some freelance jobs till the next milestone in my live started: Press Speaker Assistant of the Loveparade ’99 in Berlin. I moved to Berlin, worked for the Sonar Kollektiv (Label collective of Jazzanova) until a friend of mine hired me to help him setting up the Software Startup go_Disko*. I was really happy there but one day I received a mail from iTunes, where they offered me the Job as “Head of Editorial” for the German iTunes store. I started working there right after they opened in Germany – in a team of 2 people – for the next 3,5 years. Great Time it was!

After this great experience I was totally focussed on the topic “future of things.. ” and changed after some nice little jobs for BPitch Control, Puppetmastaz etc..from the music biz to the online biz. Cause at this time (and most is still)  every cool new thing was / is forbidden by law in Germany. I organized the re:publica 09 (started 6 weeks before and put all strings together) and now I’m an Online Project Manager, have my 2 own blogs, still do DJing and diggin music. I’m very curious about new strategies, recommendation systems, apps and have a dream of an aggregated platform with something like a semantic search, where you can find everything about your fave artist, movie etc.. Where you can listen for free, pay for a download or even pay per stream. All in one platform. Since 2 years I’m a paying Spotify customer. Started in Sept. 2007 using Soundcloud for my DJ mixes. All my 23 Mixes where played 15.000 times, downloaded 3.100 times in 107 countries since than. I dig music all through the internet, get recommendations from my social network, share my findings and pay wherever I can pay. I’m a very proud owner of 15.000 Vinyls and have around 160 GB well sorted music on my hard drive.

–> My philosophy: Sharing means caring – knowledge is growing when its shared.

BIO – MAD MATS (Local Talk, Raw Fusion, Basic Fingers) Stockholm

First off, we’re talking about a real DJs DJ...period! He got the technical skills, musical history and a never-ending hunger for underground dance music. Basically, he got the full package!

Stockholm born Mad Mats endeavours started in the mid 80’s when he left his break dancing career (Swedish champ 1985!) to become one of the resident DJs at Stockholm’s early hip hop jams circa 1986. In 1988 during a trip to London to experience the thriving rare groove scene he opened up his music senses to leftfield rhythms and the alternative club culture. After starting producing hip hop in the late 80s Mats started collecting “breaks & samples” which introduced him to the whole spectrum of underground dance music. This wild cocktail of music styles made him one of the most popular and respected DJs in the Stockholm club scene during the 90s and is today a DJ with a solid cult status in Sweden.

Nowadays Mats is working hard with his three labels Local Talk, Basic Fingers and Raw Fusion. All have their own identity but always with a touch of Mad Mats. As a side project Mats also got a “little” finger in the mysterious little label called GAMM...hush hush ok ;) .

By night when Mats is not touring the world spinning at various clubs and festivals he’s running the legendary Raw Fusion club in the heart of Stockholm. The club has been running strong for over 13 years with diverse guest DJs such as Theo Parrish, J-Dilla (RIP), Kerri Chandler, Peanut Butter Wolf, Gilles Peterson, Sbtrkt, Carl Craig, Jazzanova, Laurent Garnier and Dixon to name only a few. The club is still throwing parties and has become one of the most important underground club institutions in Scandinavia. Besides the Raw Fusion party Mats also runs a new house night called Unhous where he together with Tooli (24:hrs) and Jonas K delivers the best in underground house music at Stockholms hottest club venue Under Bron (Under The Bridge). Recent guest DJs includes Jimpster, Bassfort and Andreas Saag to name a few.

With a DJ career running over 25 years, we know that this open-minded b-boy has got some serious skills and have on numerous occasions been voted Sweden’s best DJ. Last time was in 2009 when he got voted number one by leading club site Clubstockholm.se where he received over 15000 votes. With a remarkable and open-minded variation you can easily find Mad Mats spinning at house/techno, hip hop/r&b or retro soul, funk & disco clubs. But most of all he prefers a freestyle session where he can mix everything up...Mad Mats style! He has been there, done that and wants to return for more. Check him out if you can, you wont be disappointed!

Along the way, he founded the gay art rock band Fagbash, and was one half of disco-pop band Captain Comatose.
Soon after arriving in Berlin, Snax began producing his solo releases from the ground up, writing and performing mostly all instruments and vocals himself. In 2004 came the release of the electronic soul manifesto From The Rocking Chair To The Stage (Mental Groove). Fall 2006 saw Snax sound incorporating more acoustic elements on his second long-player Love Pollution (TNT/Four Music), described by Snax as being “about love, loss, bitchiness and finally redemption.” The remix for the single, ‘Honeymoon’s Over’ by Konrad Black was hailed by many as the anthem of Summer 2007. Returning to his electronic funk roots, Snax released two EP’s on UK’s defDrive followed by Special Guest Star, the flagship release on his own label, Random Records. Reflecting on his rich and rewarding career and the myriad creative interactions he’s experienced, Snax founded the House Of Snaxine. To them he dedicated Up And Coming Children (Random Records) in 2010; an exciting return to form with an eye to the future. 
Snax’s performances and DJ sets deliver provocation, sleaze and fun. The result is a direct connection with the audience. His various collaborators  have included Jamie Lidell, Peaches, Joey Arias and Terranova to name a few. Upon supporting The Scissor Sisters throughout Europe as their opening act, Snax was described be front man Jake Shears as “a one man fro freak show not to be missed.”
Currently, Snax is completing his fourth album, running his label and establishing his house music alter ego, Box Office Poison."	4234	643	0	163	121	25	2021-10-05T10:50:23Z	2007-09-29T04:41:00Z	True

During the two decades of his career, his work toured internationally with the Alias, L’Alakran and Teatro Malandro companies; he published a string of dancefloor-suited gems on some of the best English and German electronic labels (Crosstown Rebels, Connaisseur, Treibstoff, Kalk Pets, Alphahouse); and he set up duos with some cult figures of the electronic scene (AG/BG with Detroit Grand Pubahs, John Keys with Dandy Jack).

His latest project, Andrès Garcia & The Ghost, came into being in 2011 with the release of Haunted Love, an album spanning between lusciously melancholic, electronic pop, funky romanticism and a hint of jazz. A multimedia live show stemmed from the record, premiered at the prominent Geneva festival La Bâtie on the same year. In 2014, along with Nic Ulmi he produced Facial (VII), a multidisciplinary show between pop songs, ethnographic conference and video."	1705	307	0	17	40	4	2020-12-27T15:40:06Z	2007-09-29T13:40:00Z	False

Anu Pillai aka Freeform Five is one of those rare artists. A veteran of the dance music scene, he started to release records on the seminal labels Classic, Glasgow Underground and NRK back in 1998. He soon worked his way into the premier league of remixers, producing some of the most stunning reworks of the last decade for artists as diverse as N*E*R*D, Brian Wilson, X-Press 2 & David Byrne, Jamie Lidell, Justin Timberlake, Felix da Housecat and The Killers – as well as work for cutting edge labels like Warp and Cocoon. 
He’s spent a small fortune carbon offsetting his airmiles with DJ & live appearances at Fabric / The End / Ministry of Sound (London), Space / Manumission / Ibiza Rocks (Ibiza), Cocoon (Frankfurt), Watergate / Cookies / Week End (Berlin), Razzmatazz (Barcelona), D-Edge (Sao Paolo), Womb / Ageha / Unit (Tokyo), Rex / Social Club / Paris Paris (Paris), LAX (LA), and Lux (Lisbon) – plus tours of Scandinavia, Australia, America, and all the major festivals, including Glastonbury, T In The Park, Benicassim, Parklife and Pukkelpop. Anu has also released Freeform Five’s debut album ‘Strangest Things’ on Atlantic records, two massive DJ mix albums, ‘Bisous Bisous II’ & ‘Misch Masch’ and contributed to several of Kitsuné’s genre defining compilations.
Following a relentless touring schedule, Anu decided to take a break from Freeform Five a few years back to concentrate on writing, producing & remixing for the likes of Ladyhawke, Santigold, William Orbit, Eve, Lana Del Rey, Deadmau5, Little Boots and Roisin Murphy amongst others. He also set up boundary-pushing label Perspex Recordings with releases from Chicago legend Derrick Carter, French rockers Poney Poney /Jamaica (produced by Xavier from Justice) and Swedish auteur ‘The Subliminal Kid’ (producer of Fever Ray & Matthew Dear) along with remixes by like minded friends such as Gabriel Ananda, Riton, Tomboy & Riva Starr. 
Anu has always thought outside the box. His remix of Isolee's 'Beau Mot Plage' redefined the art of remixing, juxtaposing the micro synthesis of the original with intricate Afro & Latin polyrhythms, creating a bona-fide house music classic. Remixes of Llorca's ""Indigo Blues"" and Isolee's ""Brazil.com"" fused west African kora, Indian orchestrations and classical harp within a house music template and on the Freeform Five track 'Eeeeaaooww' he merged disco licks with Bounty Killer's dancehall patois. 
Anu returned to the scene by collaborating with Gambian griot and master musician Juldeh Camara (a member of Robert Plant's Sensational Space Shifters band) for ""Weltareh"" on Eskimo recordings.  He also hooked up with Berlin's white hot Exploited crew for the jacking pure analog ""Brandy Alexander."" And now on ""Leviathan"" he teams up with the legendary Roisin Murphy for an exercise in irresistible vocal power and anthemic feel good house.
Tom Trago, Compuphonic and Cage & Aviary join the the stellar list of super talented artists who've been invited to remix Freeform Five tracks (following on from Tiefschwarz, Radioslave, Alter Ego, Lindstrom, Mylo, M.A.N.D.Y, Switch, Ewan Pearson, Jackson & His Computer Band, Prins Thomas and Maurice Fulton to name a few) along with a stunning re-work from Anu himself.

Already from the start music has played a big part in his life, coming from a musical family and attending the local music institute at an early age. Starting out focusing on the guitar and the piano, he later on started making hip-hop music. In 2006 he moved to Stockholm, Sweden where he met his compatriot Jani Inkeroinen from psy trance group Trollscientists who got him interested in electronic music. For the moment Jonas is studying Audio engineering – Sound design and music production at SAE Institute Stockholm, but he’ll be moving back to Finland soon, where he’s planning to found his own studio.
As an artist Jonas aims at creating minimalistic electro house for the dancefloors, with a sound focusing on fat bass lines and electro. Jonas hasn’t realeased anything yet, still looking for an adequate record label that shares his musical visions.

Muallem has always focused his attentions on the communal experience of dancing. This love was incubated in Munich, a city where Muallem first found himself sneaking into clubs at the tender age of 15. Over the years, his career saw him produce and perform under many guises and live across the world exploring local scenes and movements whilst refining his own DJ craft. However, it was when he returned to Munich after over a decade abroad, that Muallem was able to make his biggest mark on electronic music and its community. 

Playing a key role at influential Munich club Bob Beaman, Muallem was the creative director and programmer until May 2016. Also occupying a resident slot, he rapidly gained a reputation for a vast depth of music knowledge, which he uses knitting together house, techno and disco jams drawn from across the decades. His immersion within the Munich scene saw him busy running SMiLE Festival and affiliated Art of Dance nights until 2017 when he opened Blitz, one of Europe’s most respected club institutions. Here his progressive music policy, dynamic understanding of audio acoustics as well as an appreciation of the relationship between DJ and dance floor came to the fore. 

His desire to open venues and create a blank canvas for artists to express themselves was also driven by wanting to create a club that makes you part of something, a community and a place of freedom for the people who are fleeing the everyday. His DJing feeds this atmosphere of escapist hedonism and elevates the crowd to those transcendent dance floor moments. As the creative director of Blitz, the risks he takes with club programming are reflected in the risks he takes with his selection while DJing, a talent which places him amongst the scenes established taste making luminaries. Always working to find unheard cuts or records others might stay away from, it was the educated crowds at Bob Beaman and Blitz that served as the perfect foil for him to master this craft as a selector.

With regular and mostly long lasting closing sets at Panorama Bar as well as landmark sets at Robert Johnson, Printworks, DC:10, Rex Club, IFZ, Bar Americas and Shelter, his international profile has grown to match his domestic reputation as a DJ with a revered approach to track selection and ability to inject ecstatic vibes into any party. Performing internationally allowed him to realise that a great experience on the dancefloor is such a universal happening that the location doesn’t matter. 

Another milestone on Muallems storied timeline is the creation of LGBTQI+ night Cruise. Finding its home at Blitz, Cruise is a project close to his heart that he created with two close companions, Gio and Werner. The idea for the night was established over the years out of the desire to promote inclusivity for all with a forward thinking approach to music, something which has been a defining trend throughout Muallems career. Muallem considers the night as “blueprint for what Blitz is about”, no wonder it’s international acclaim goes hand in hand with the club. 

He understands the primary purpose of a club and a DJ is to make people dance TOGETHER, so as a performer he is one that lets the music do the work for him. Selecting tunes that feel familiar yet new, Muallem has a connection with the crowd that only an experienced dancefloor campaigner can attain.


In 2020, Muallem took the chance of nightlife’s closure due to the global pandemic in the form of creating his very own musical imprint, CHILDHOOD. So far, the label released singles by DJ Deep & Don Williams as well as albums by Mr. G and CYRK."	4816	3	0	10	17	1	2021-11-08T13:20:09Z	2007-10-03T12:59:00Z	False

Now in its seventh year, Still Music has been instrumental in the worldwide proliferation of some of America’s freshest underground dance music. From raw disco to beautiful, refined techno, and stopping at every tempo and mood between and beyond, Still Music and its sublabels Past Due and Love For Music have found room to include artists both established and new, releasing what can only be described as GOOD music. 

This is the natural way of working for Mr. Derradji, who moved to the US in 2000 and cut his teeth working with various record shops and electronic music distributors in Chicago. He decided to launch Still Music in 2004, with the inaugural release featuring Amp Fiddler from Detroit remixing Patchworks from France. With this template set, Still Music went on to release music from veteran dance producers such as Rick Wilhite and Gerald Mitchell, while also stretching out into other genres on Randolph’s “Lonely Eden” album and Seun Kuti’s political afrobeat on “Think Africa”. Still also dropped the In The Dark compilation, showcasing the then-emerging Detroit house sound and featuring the production debut of Keith Worthy, which was touted as Groove Magazine’s #1 release the month it came out. These credentials have earned Still Music “Label of the Month” status in XLR8R magazine and on leading dance music site Resident Advisor. 

Not satisfied with Still Music’s impressive breadth and depth, Jerome also launched two highly successful sublabels to compliment the main label. Past Due records is the place for long-forgotten independent disco and funk gems to be unearthed, reissued, and remixed by modern producers, bringing artists like DIT and Greyship Daviz into the spotlight they (wrongfully!) never achieved the first time around. Love For Music (also known as Stilove4music) is the label dedicated to more underground sounds, from disco edits to lo-fi house and techno madness."	10804	55	0	2	11	1	2020-12-16T21:33:10Z	2007-10-03T16:11:00Z	True

He is producing tunes with Henry L aka Henry L & Ingo Sänger. Their sound is influenced by classic Detroit and Chicago House, which often flirts with Disco and Boogie. These mirror ball fantasies are joined by their Funk, Soul and Jazz stamped Hiphop roots. 

Ingo is also part of the duo Westpark Unit (with Herb LF) and runs the label Farside Records. 

From 1995 to 2004 he used to play on german radiostation WDR 1Live and founded the Treibhaus show that was quite influential for a lot of DJs & upcoming artists. Since 2010 he is back on air with a monthly radioshow on ByteFM. He played in almost every good club in Germany and of course different intl. DJ spots here and there. Sometimes you can find him playing with musicians (eg. harpist) as well.

“Frankfurt native Andreas Baumecker aka nd_baumecker began his DJ career in 1991 in a bar called Romantica, located near the city’s main train station. The venue was run by legendary nightlife impresario Hans Romanov, who also operated Intimbar, where Baumecker would eventually move on to a short time later. It’s there that Ata and Heiko M/S/O from Playhouse took notice, inviting Baumecker to work as a buyer for their record store Delirium and offering him a residency at their seminal WildPitchClub night at the Club Nachtleben. Soon, Baumecker was regularly playing Frankfurt’s numerous electronic music venues (Box, XS, Music Hall, Dorian Grey), before moving on to Heidelberg, where he promoted the club night HD800 together with Dirk Mantei aka D-Man. After a short stop in Mannheim, regular guest DJ sets at Berghain / Panorama Bar predecessor club OstGut in Berlin, and establishing his own label Freundinnen Audio, nd_baumecker moved to the German capital in 2004. There he not only picked up a residency at Panorama Bar inside the newly opened Berghain but also started a job as the club’s in-house booker.
Stylistically, Baumecker covers a truly broad spectrum of dance music, refusing to be limited by genre: ""A well known choreographer once said: 'Surprise is important.’ I think this approach describes my DJ style best. I’m constantly oscillating between disco, house, techno, electro, broken beats and pop. Ultimately, I’m open to anything – from brute force to tender. I see the dance floor an experimental field: If you manage to really capture the crowd, you can do almost anything with them."" Of course, the flow of tracks and resolving musical differences plays a key role in achieving just that, and few DJs are as adept at uniting fundamentally disparate sounds, different keys, different rhythms and different atmospheres. „If something sounds truly new to me they give me a jolt. Also, dance music should have a good portion of funk and, in a way, it needs to sound like disco, whatever the style. I like vocals a lot. In my opinion they are the most important and significant bits you’re taking home after a good night out; they’re the most memorable.""
Since 2010 nd also produces with Sam Barker as Barker & Baumecker. The duo have released four 12”s and two albums on Ostgut Ton, operating musically between dancefloor and spiraling left field electronics. Finally, 2018 sees release of nd_baumecker’s Panorama Bar 07 DJ mix.”"	31903	844	0	134	109	22	2021-08-23T21:41:11Z	2007-10-05T15:31:00Z	False

Don Rogall has been creating various new music movements for 3 decades with incomparable artistic freedom, delivering the soundtrack of subculture in over 120 venues in his town Berlin and over 100 genre-defining clubs in 18 countries all over the world. 

From the jazzier beginnings in the depth of Rare grooves to sampling culture and the avant-garde of 90s electronica & Headz to Raves & House, Dub, Drum'n'Bass and all types of breakbeats to various live-sound systems. 
He is heavily into the early beginnings of DJ roots of 50s and 60s music based on Rhythm, Blues, Soul & early Rock'n'Roll, as well as pop punk-culture to many influences from around the globe and a passion for Exotica music and soundtrack related stuff. 

Don has contributed to Arts Festivals, created soundtracks for his own Burlesque, Variety & Circus Sideshows, as well as many fashion shows of established designers, programming playlists for corporate, bars, hotels, performing artists, mixed sound for motion pictures, taught upcoming artists and DJs (also at the Berlin DJ Music Academy) and had countless own releases in various musical genres with several bands. With one of them, Nylon,  he headlined the German Spiegel magazine for modernizing German music.

334	SHIR KHAN	Jan Simon 	Spielberger	Jan Simon  Spielberger	Berlin	https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000234538563-77n4at-large.jpg	27	56	"Shir Khan is leader of Berlin’s deephouse label Exploited. He keeps a label residency at Berlin’s Watergate, hosts a weekly radioshow at Radio Fritz since 8 years, keeps playing all major european cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, Zuerich, Barcelona, Istanbul, continues to release disco edits on Black Jukebox (his disco imprint) as well as eclectic and diverse music on his Secret Gold Series and just launched a new sublabel: Exploited Ghetto.

THUMP: ‘Back in 2007, the born and bred Berliner Shir Khan began Exploited, a hybrid record label boasting an impressive roster of artists, and a heavy, deep house sound. Eight years later, Exploited is a staple in the music libraries of underground house fans worldwide. It’s an exciting time for the creatives behind the brand, as their name has expanded to include Exploited Ghetto, a sub-label that promises the same bouncy club tunes the project was initially founded on.’

DJMAG: ‘Berlin-based Shir Khan has been wowing us via his wide-reaching DJ sets and excellent Exploited label since 2007. Currently occupying the groove between deep disco, old school house and hip-hop flavoured re-edits, his roster includes the likes of Claptone, Adana Twins, Doctor Dru and Joyce Muniz.‘

DEEPHOUSE AMSTERDAM: ‘The German house label Exploited, which is known for great releases and great parties alike, has announced the release of a new sublabel, according to Mixmag. Exploited, the magnificent label from Berlin, can surely be called one of the leading labels of contemporary house music. With a string of excellent releases during the past few years, the label is now branching out into Exploited Ghetto. The new sublabel will focus on bringing new acts into the scene. Much of what the label does will be focused on one-off releases, from people yet not in the Exploited roster.’

FAZE MAG: ‘Exploited avancierte über die Jahre zu einer der ersten Adressen im Bereich zeitgenössischer House Musik und diente Künstlern wie Adana Twins, Claptone oder Doctor Dru als Sprungbrett zu einer steilen, internationalen Karriere. Aber auch Shir Khan selbst profitierte vom Hype um sein Label und wurde so im Zuge dessen zu einem global gefragten DJ. Wenn es um deutsche Houselabels geht, ist Exploited schon lange kein Geheimtip mehr. Mittlerweile hat sich das Berliner Imprint zu einer stetigen Erscheinung in Charts und Plattenkoffern avanciert. Nun steht mit Exploited Ghetto ein Sublabel an.’

Exploited label founder, internationally renowed DJ, remixer, promoter, radiohost, world-traveller and new talent spotter, Berlin resident Shir Khan is truly a jack-of-all-trades and might be one of the city’s hottest names. Having grown the label since 2007, Exploited has played host to some of the most innovative, cutting-edge electronic talent and has been on a quest for high quality, diverse and forward-thinking releases. In 2012 Shir Khan pushed the career of newcomers like Claptone, Adana Twins, Doctor Dru,Homework or Joyce Muniz and managed to establish plenty of Number 1 Beatport Deephouse Hits with his label.
With the launch of BLACK JUKEBOX, Shir Khan dipped his toes into the world of disco edits:
Slo-mo housed up boogie-soul, presented in a nicely recut fashion reminiscent of the great Tiger & Woods. The Black Jukebox Series has become a secret weapon for many big DJs such as Soul Clap, Solomun, Axel Boman and even A-Trak. 
Until now, Shir Khan has released 15 chapters of Black Jukebox. The first Vinyl editions became heavy collector items with prices going up to 350€ at Discogs.
Shir Khan also launched SECRET GOLD which features extended family members and a new sublabel called Exploited Ghetto. Furthermore, Shir Khan will be also presenting DANCING&ROMANCING, a Double-CD that features music for home listening and clubbing."	21332	60	0	177	35	26	2021-05-12T15:44:23Z	2007-10-07T22:04:00Z	False

He is well known for his particularly funky use of Roland’s sh101 analog synth, and for his particularly emotional and personal melodies and harmonies.

There is no doubt that after more than 20 years of teaching himself production processes, complex midi programming and harmonies, Fabrice’s sound is unique and recognisable among the thousands of weekly techno releases.

Demonstrations of these skills appear on the crème de la crème of electronic music labels such as KMS (Kevin Saunderson), Planet-e (Carl Craig), Submerge, R&S, Third Ear, 7th City Records (Dan Bell), F-Communications (Laurent Garnier) , Versatile, Classic, Compost, Subject Detroit, Motech, Raygun, Playhouse Records, Kanzleramt (Heiko Laux), 70 Drums (Ken Ishii), Clone, Trapez ltd and so on...An exceptional discography into mythic labels, into history of electronic music.
By the end of 1998, after his first DJ and production experiences, under the Interwaves and Bug Orchestra nicknames, Fabrice was elevated to the ranks of the Detroit musical elite by Mad Mike himself, thanks to his classic remix of E-Dancer’s Banjo track on KMS: “Fabrice is a part of Detroit music's history by being the first white producer to record on KMS, and the first double groove recording from NSC”.
Fabrice has built a solid discography and reputation, confirmed by his reknowned appearances at the world’s best clubs & festival line ups such as Panorama Bar-Berlin, Fabric - London, Womb-Tokyo, Detroit Fuse-In Festival, Fuse - Brussels, Loft - Barcelona, Sub Club - Glasgow, The End - London, Sonar Festival, world famous official Montreux Jazz Festival, Bourges festival (On stage with Jean-Michel Jarre ), to name but a few. One of the highlight of Fabrice dj career is the paper into Detroit Free press where his performance was voted best dj Set of 2005’s Detroit Fuse-in Festival.
Fabrice also collaborated and remixed some artists like Laurent Garnier, Kevin Saunderson, Agoria, DJ Hell, Ken Ishii, Kenny Hawkes, Rob Mello, Frederic Galliano, Chymera, Trüby Trio…
After his last Soul Designer's album on Third Ear (2007), Fabrice decided to take a bit of a break from music and concentrate on some educational projects. Nevertheless, he released his classic Purple Raw EP on Versatile in that period, as well as some own EPs on R&S, Subject Detroit, .. next to a few remixes. Over the last few months however, Fabrice quietly prepared the celebration of 20 years of music by producing a new album with the idea to make a strong “come back” with fresh material for late 2014.
And when Carl Craig first heard ""Galactic Soul Odysseys"", he instantly decided to invite Fabrice to join Planet E's prestigious family. Once again, Fabrice work is entering history of music through one of the most respected labels from the techno community.
Fabrice is really excited to be back on tour for live performances around the globe and to present that new material to his fans...

As Jean-Michel Jarre said in an interview for MTV : ""What is touching me in Fabrice Lig's career is the way he is following his own line, without caring about trends, and that's the path an artist should follow. It is not post Detroit, it's an emotion""

For him being a DJ (or a producer) is not a final objective, but a means to party, to share music and feelings. A way to give back to the music scene that gave him so much in his life.

Miles away from nowadays inter-continental DJ circuit he prefers to party and to share his music in intimate clubs and at their own „bag of goodies“ nights. Music is the passion that drives his every heartbeat and it shows in every project he’s been involved so far. Driven by the feel of the occasion and as likely to draw for a classic house record as throwing a disco curveball or dropping one of his African bombs into the mix, he makes his true passion for dance music and culture show in every selection.

He started DJing in 1994, throwing small house parties in a rather quirky location, before teaming up with Emanuela De Luca running their „bag of goodies“ nights up until today. He also published a dance-music print magazine called „ouk“ from 1996-2003 which supplied the music communities in Germany, Switzerland and Austria with then scarce (the internet was just around the corner) yet desperately needed information and stories about the music scene. He also shared several music columns in the local newspaper.

In 2004 he started making his own music under the moniker of „Dancing Djedi“ releasing a quite successful 12“ called „Body Music“ on the Swedish „G.A.M.M.“ label. Currently he’s roaming the german Ruhrpott-area and working on some new tracks under the moniker of Trent Quattro."	673	203	0	157	133	19	2020-04-06T15:58:06Z	2007-10-10T18:04:03Z	False

  ""Peelie, Charlie, Gilles, Annie...Nick Luscombe has become one of those radio titans."" (Straight No Chaser) 
                  
For over 15 years Nick Luscombe has been committed to seek out and share quality, modern music across many genres, styles and sounds through his radio shows and DJ sets. XFM provided a platform for his popular Flomotion show from 2000 to 2006, and it then moved to the programme's current home at Resonance FM.  

Nick also presents the Sony Award-winning BBC Radio 3 Late Junction programme and is a regular guest on Monocle 24 and BBC 6 Music.

An exclusive monthly in-flight version of Flomotion can also be heard on all British Airways flights. 

As a globe-trotting radio producer, he has produced radio shows that have taken him far afield to discover the sounds of Cuba, Jamaica, Japan, South Africa and Morocco. He also produced BBC Radio 2 series `The Sound of The City', presented by one of Nick’s broadcsting heroes, the late Charlie Gillett.

Nick was also instrumental in the production of David Sylvian’s `Amplified Gesture'. Nick interviewed Christian Fennesz, Sachiko M., Toshimaru Nakamura, Evan Parker, Eddie Prévost, Keith Rowe, John Tilbury, Otomo Yoshihide, among others for the project. It stands as one of the most definitive films about improvised music ever made.

Nick’s passionate curation and promotion of countless live music and DJ showcases at venues as varied as Cargo in Shoreditch, the Royal Festival Hall and the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, has, over the past decade, helped provide a dynamic platform for new artists and his popular radio shows have helped inspire a new generation of electronic music producers.

Nick’s club DJing has taken him to venues throughout the UK and Europe and around the world to Singapore, Scandinavia, Japan, the USA and India. He continues to maintain a number of London residencies across the city.

Nick has DJed and hosted stages at many outdoor festivals and events such as the Big Chill Festival, Big Chill Goa, Secret Garden Party, Bestival, Green Man, Somerset House outdoor film screenings, Thames Festival Main Stage and `Freedom Sunset’ near Tokyo. Nick was also selected to represent the best of British DJs at a British Council week-long event in India.

His eclectic DJ sets represent a feast of musical styles, each a one-off and tailor made for that night. His eclectic deep club sounds blend moody and futuristic house with electronica, jazz, techno, soul, disco and hip hop.

One of the industry’s most exciting breakout talents, La Fleur is blazing a trail impossible to ignore. From her highly lauded collaboration with Sasha ‘Förbindelse’ that scored an Essential New Tune, to her stunning debut on Kompakt’s Speicher series ‘Tears’ and the relaunch of her Power Plant label with the exquisite ‘Aphelion’ EP, her elegant take on house and techno continues to captivate.

Power Plant stands for freedom and is a breeding ground for La Fleur’s various creative projects. It’s birthed the Power Plant ‘Elements’ fashion line and also seen the Swedish artist explore her passion for visual arts sourcing illustrators and painters for the label’s cover slicks.

Special music creations come in spades. There’s the classic ‘Flowerhead’ that launched Power Plant and the iconic ‘Nightflow’ and ‘Arms Around’ EPs, remixed by Kenny Larkin and Carl Craig respectively. Superb original material has dropped on Truesoul, Last Night On Earth and Watergate Records. On the remix tip, she’s worked her magic on Sasha, Kerri Chandler and Damian Lazarus & Ancient Moons.

The former Mixmag breakthrough artist is in high demand for her DJ skills, buoyed by a critically acclaimed Essential Mix last summer. Recent and upcoming gig highlights include Sonus Festival, Tomorrowland, Melt! Festival, Junction 2, Ultra Music Festival Miami, Resistance Ibiza, Lollapalooza Stockholm, Fusion, Creamfields, Loveland, Warehouse Project and the tastemaker favourite Department Festival on home soil in Stockholm."	51012	84	0	202	315	39	2021-03-10T15:32:37Z	2007-10-11T14:04:00Z	True

He said El Perro Negro was irreplaceable. Then he was lost for days, weeks and months, everybody thought he was dead, but he was not dead, he was celebraiting along side El General, a ritual for leaving the past behind. They were going like muevelo muevelo, pum pum mami mami y no me trates de engañar. This period of absence of more than six months gave him the name of El Mata Culebras, name given to him by a Chola Caderona in Panama City the day he stopped the celebration for half a day to rescue her from the bad intentions of a cobra, that wanted to kill her. He became known as one of the most incredible snake charmers around in the Caribbean and the Pacific coast dominating all cobras and other poisonous snakes making them his disciples. Even Arabs, Hindus and specially Persians knew him for his abilities in snake charming. Many people by that time thought he had a pact with the devil, but after a few years nobody was saying that anymore. Instead they were saying he was the devil himself, El Diablo!	1609	92	0	11	8	1	2021-06-26T19:55:51Z	2007-10-11T22:35:54Z	False

It’s been amazing twenty years since me and my friends started organizing illegal raves in the squat houses of Helsinki in early 90s. Most bizarre experience must have been DJing for Jean-Paul Gaultier and Helena Christensen at a Berlin fetish club Kit Kat after their first ever Berlin show. Most flashy ones have been entertaining the rich & famous of Hong Kong or Russia while warming up Chemical Brothers, Paul van Dyk or Underworld was something I’ll never forget. From the venues I’ve DJed Tresor in Berlin, Pacha in Ibiza, Ministry of Sound in London and CODE in Tokyo were special places to play.

My recording career started in 1998 with Slusnik Luna’s Nicklas Renqvist. ‘Unity‘ was signed to british Steelfish label and found it’s way to Gatecrasher and Renaissance compilations. Sasha and Oakenfold opened their Essential Mixes with it and Pete Tong played it on BBC Radio 1. Gigs with DJ Tiesto lead into signing to his Black Hole label while other releases include ‘Embrace’ on Five AM and ‘Beautiful‘ on Sential (finnish national singles chart #1). Most famous colaborations include ‘YearZero‘ together with Andy Moor, ‘God’s Garden‘ together with David West and ‘Zeitgeist‘ with Solarstone. My remixes include Aalto’s ‘Rush‘ made together with Super8, Stage One remix made for Hooj Choons, Way Out West’s ‘Killa‘ and more recently a bootleg remix of Hans Zimmer’s ‘Time‘ from Inception soundtrack which Paul Oakenfold loved so much he did his own edit. In 2011 I released my third artist album “20” which also celebrates my twenty years of DJing.

As promoters we have come a very long way from the days of illegal warehouse raves. Together with my friends, we have run Club Unity for over ten years, promoted Renaissance’s events in Helsinki and organized events called “Pacifique” for almost 3000 people in a water park. We have had fun at 16 hour Sunday clubbing sessions at DTM and have brought Jose Padilla to Finland. We have organised events on boats, in parks, on ice-skating rinks and even did one of Finland’s first flash mobs: the infamous One Minute Raves. The longest set I’ve ever played was 23 hours on New Year’s Day in 2010. To me electronic music and club culture has always been about open-mindness, unity amongst people and pushing the musical boundaries forward, whether it’s ambient concert in a park or full on rave in warehouse. Uniting the sounds, the minds, the people…"	27570	294	0	81	759	2	2021-09-25T07:08:07Z	2007-11-12T09:20:04Z	True

619	Boris	NULL	NULL	NULL	Berlin	https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-U6DPbNzGlkymkLzi-61gtGw-large.jpg	0	20	"Boris musical roots reach back to the mid 80s, when he lived in New York for four years where he absorbed the unique spirit of the seminal club Paradise Garage weekend after weekend. From the Club’s mentor Larry Levan Boris learned to believe in his musical intuition as well as a broad musical spectrum, which nowadays ranges from Disco, Hi-NRG, Post-Punk and (Kraut-) Rock to House and Techno, all of which Boris loves to throw into one set. „Music was most important for Levan. He was uncompromising and he knew how to convey it. That’s what I’m trying to achieve, too, when I’m djing.“

Many years later, Boris became a resident at Panorama Bar’s first incarnation in Berlin, where he was able to build a loyal following by playing long sets lasting until noon. „The crowd is always a lot more receptive for music at the end than at the beginning. That’s when I rather have the opportunity to present unusual stuff and that’s when I’m able to let my feelings run freely.“
After the old OstGut/Panorama Bar closed, Boris played in almost every club in Berlin, but when the follow up club Berghain opened its doors in 2004, he quickly focused on playing out here again. From 2005 till 2010 he had another musical platform, as he was taking care of the label Careless Records as an A&R. As a DJ, he is not exactly keen on refining a certain genre, but rather to push music with a certain twist."	28307	49	0	8	34	0	2021-10-27T20:13:19Z	2007-11-12T19:16:45Z	True

This influenced him to change his take on music: putting aside the guitar, quitting the band he was playing in. One year later, he happened to start his DJ career in small venues around Zurich.

A long break from classic musicianship followed, with time mostly spent in clubs, studios and record stores till it was time for Demetrio to get re-involved by the end of the 90`s, and in 2001, he released his first white label record on his imprint M.A.R..

In 2002, he organized his first party “vibrator 02″ on Zurich’s busiest weekend of the year: that of the Street Parade. It was an after hour on the following Sunday morning, featuring acts like Dixon, Peak Nick & Ilo and lot of others..

From 2005 on, his monthly nine hours net radio show m.a.r. was broadcasted via audioasyl.net.One year laters he founded the “vollscharf – wollscharf” after hour event series, aiming to bring to music to the people and the people to the lake side, where these outdoor parties were taking place. This series featured artists including Marshall Jefferson, Mike Huckaby, The Deep Dicks and a lot of others.

2007 saw the respected British label Third Ear getting interested in tracks by Demetrio, which were finally released in 2009 on the „Talk EP“. In 2008, the track „Eleven“ was released on the Drumpoet “verse 2″12 inch, earning a lot of positive feedback.

Early 2009, he got the chance to remix one of Deep House’s legends, Chez Damier, the result of which was released in December 2009 on Mojuba’s G.O.D.2 . After that, Chez Damier and Demetrio joined forces as producers on several projects and as well as label joint venture between Chez`s Balance Alliance and Demetrio’s Enterbt Rec. The first collaboration to be released was the “Adventures in Barcelona” EP (the tracks credited to Timnah Sommerfeldt, „Feel Me Up“ and a dub version of the same number, were in fact produced by Chez Damier and Demetrio Giannice), out on Balance Alliance/ Enterbt – BA 006 in January. 2010.

2011 the second EP for Third Ear followed entitled „Slow“, as well as new productions due on his own Enterbt Records, some Remixes, he appeared on some VA Releases on Quarter Notes, Hizou or Snuff Trax to name a few. In the same year, he had the opportunity to produce and mix a R&B/Downtempo Album for a no name Band released for free and Digitally only.

After a little studio-break he decided to start to work on a Album for Balance (which is still in progress, to be released 2014) along with some remixes for the ones like Morris Audio City Sport Edition (Released Dec. 2012), the forthcoming Enterbt Black Edition and a lot of other hidden projects.

Recently he got the chance ti mix one of the Deep House Classic produced by Victor Simonelli i want you to know to be released in December 2013/January 2014 on Deep Down Slam. Again, there’s a lot more to come for 2014, but it’s not yet the moment to talk about all that.

Stay tuned!

A member of the Swedish electronic pop group, The Knife, Olof has been involved in different cultural projects where music plays a central role in communicating political beliefs. His solo project, Oni Ayhun, plays with stereotypical ideas and norms about gender in dance and experimental music.
 
Starting djing around 98' at local school parties, he ran his first club in high school and has been djing since. He started out playing Disco, House, Garage, and Drum n' bass playing more Hip Hop and R&B in the early 2000's. Following this was a long period of playing harder Techno and House, including EBM and Shranz. The last decade has seen him playing mostly throughout Europe when he's not too busy producing music in his Berlin studio.
 

Currently, as a DJ, Olof plays a mix of West African pop music, Kuduro, Acid, Hip Hop, R&B, and melodic Techno and House. 
 
He enjoys making fun edits and remixes to play in his sets. He recently remixed the Swedish Batucada group, Yacombe. You can hear it in the opening of his Rinse FM mix.

He’s currently producing music for friends like Planningtorock, Zhala, and Houwaida Hedfi aka Hiya wal Âalam- a band in which he also plays the flute & percussion."	8501	9	0	6	2	0	2020-10-30T09:41:03Z	2007-11-16T13:52:13Z	False

Once he started following his own direction, his sound started to become sparer before arriving comfortably at his signature minimal-meets-dubstep sound that’s both familiar and new. He’s remixed for Sutekh and released on Earsugar (Berlin), Cosmic Sounds (London), rx-tx (Ljubljana) and Public Records (San Francisco), as well as sharing stages with luminaries like Digital Mystikz, Mrk1, Loefah, the Bug, Modeselektor, 2562, Substance, Dedbeat...
His devastating combination of sub bass, dub sirens and syncopated rhythms really draws out the tension in the crowd.

As longtime and wellknown DJ for House, UK Garage, D&B, or member of the one and only german 2step legend Gush Collective (with e.g. Matt Flores), labelchef of Draft Recordings and Metromusic, together with Cassique & M.Petit founder of one of the most favoured netlabels supafeed.net, or as him being part of the duo Westpark Unit (with Ingo Sänger), you won ́t find any german activist that did not own something out of the Herb LF Nordstadt FM studio. 
If you are searching for funk, soul, dub or jazz in modern clubmusic, Herb LF is the right one. In the meantime you can listen to that on more than 100 releases. 
Additionally he started the profession of Mastering the music of some artists & labels like Farside, Freude Am Tanzen, Musik Krause, Robag Wruhme, Kadebostan and of course nearly all of his releases and productions. It seems that this guy never leaves the studio... However he found time enough to present his DJ skills on countless gigs all over europe. 
For his latest project Discoshit he teamed up with Phil Decker from Sensual Touch Recordings. Together they will start soon a new vinyl and digital imprint called REST! Their new label will present artists like Discoshit, Elina Monova, Morgenklang and of course Herb LF himself.  

Es fällt schwer alle Aktivitäten und Produktionen von Herb LF in einem Info unterzubringen. Ebenso lässt sich Herb LF nicht ganz so einfach musikalisch festzurren. 
Als bestens bekannter langjähriger House, UK Garage oder Drum & Bass DJ, Mitglied der deutschen 2Step Legende Gush Collective (u.a. mit Matt Flores), Labelchef von Draft Recordings sowie Metromusic, zusammen mit Cassique & M.Petit Macher eines der weltweit beliebtesten Netlabels supafeed.net, oder als Teil des Westpark Unit Duos (mit Ingo Sänger), kommt man zwischen Düsseldorf und Dortmund um Produktionen aus dem Nordstadt FM Studio nicht herum. 
Wer den Funk, Dub, Soul und Jazz in der aktuellen Clubmusik vermisst, kann ihn bei Herb LF finden. Mittlerweile ist er auf mehr als 100 Veröffentlichungen zu hören. Als wäre das nicht genug für Studio Wizzard Herb LF, ist er mittlerweile auch Masteringexperte für u.a. Farside, Freude Am Tanzen, Musik Krause, Robag Wruhme, Kadebostan und selbstverständlich für die allermeisten seiner eigenen Veröffentlichungen. Trotzdem fand er noch Zeit genug, sich auf unzähligen Gigs in ganz Europa als DJ zu präsentieren. 
Für sein neuestes Projekt Discoshit tat er sich mit Phil Decker von Sensual Touch Recordings zusammen. Darüber hinaus werden die beiden in Kürze ein neues Vinyl & Digitallabel namens REST! starten. Die ersten Veröffentlichungen von u.a. Discoshit, Morgenklang, Elina Monova und natürlich von Herb LF selbst, sind bereits fertig produziert und erscheinen in Kürze."	2058	161	0	105	23	21	2020-04-30T21:12:52Z	2007-11-16T23:53:37Z	False

Rocco’s career started in small underground Techno influenced clubs in Lyons, France, where he learned his trade alongside DJs like Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Louie Vega and DJ Deep.

After a stint in Portugal, Rocco teamed up with Alex Santos and Manoo in 2001 to form Rodamaal. 
The group quickly got a lot of attention and caught the ear of Ben Watt (from Everything But The Girl) who was starting his Buzzin’ Fly label at the time. Various EPs and singles for Buzzin’ Fly followed but it is the ‘Insomnia’ single - remixed by Âme - that is definitively the biggest single for Rodamaal, and it remains a Deep House classic.

While still working with his friends from Rodamaal Rocco started to release solo projects on various prestigious labels like Freerange, Defected, MN2S, Real Tone, and it is his single ‘Someday’, released on Real Tone - Franck Roger’s label - that propelled him as a major player status in the Deep House scene.
Following the success of these releases Rocco went traveling extensively all over the world spreading a unique sound combining Deep House, Minimal, Techno and Classic House.

Over the years Rocco has developed a huge following in South Africa, where it is not rare to see him perform in stadiums in front of 30,000-strong crowds. And it was on a South African label that Rocco released in 2013 his 'The Bridge' album, bridging indeed the gap between Europe, South Africa and the US and featuring collaborations between the French producer and artists and vocalists from South Africa and the US.

Rocco has been collaborating for a couple of years now with Klement Bonelli on productions and/or remixes and it is on Klement Bonelli’s own label Krome Records that Rocco released his vastly influential ‘TBT3’ track. Laurent Garnier, who had been supporting Rocco’s productions for many years, included it on his recent DJ Mag compilation. ‘TBT3’ is a milestone in Rocco’s career as it points toward the new musical direction Rocco and his soon to be launched label is exploring.

Following the success of his most recent releases, including the hit single “Get On Up!” peaking at #6 on the official ARIA Australian Charts, the full stack recording artist, writer, producer, label owner is gearing up for a string of new releases – celebrating two decades since his debut “DISH” on Virgin Records.

A proud Filipino, Andy Roda was born in Copenhagen, graduated in New York City, now living in Berlin. Classically trained, he is a musician equally comfortable in jazz, soul, r’n’b – with roots in gospel, as singing weekly in his local church, was the nurturing ground during his childhood.

As a writer, Roda constructs his lyric accompanied dance [house] music in a traditional manner, and his versatile skills puts him in full control of his musical and visual output, mastering both music arrangement, production, and visual editing.

Since 2018 he has toured as a singer, dancer, actor in the hit show “BEAT IT” – a pop theatre musical based the life of the “King Of Pop” Michael Jackson across Europe, serving the role as “Acting Captain”, and substitute to “young Michael’.

The previous year he joined a star studded Danish cast in the theatre production of Susanne Bier’s Oscar nominated movie “Efter Brylluppet” (After The Wedding), directed by Peter Langdal.

Aside from his solo releases and theatre work, notable mentions are his tours as lead vocalist for platinum selling Danish Act Safri Duo, competing as the pioneering Filipino artist in the Eurovision Song Contest with his own song “Love Is Love”, as well as in Ed McMahon’s “Next Big Star” on American Television. He has opened for the Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls’ Emma Bunton, as well as written music for Asian boybands Mr. Tiger and S9F, and Philippines’ “Ultimate Showgirl” Vina Morales.

An advocate for his local communities, Roda co-founded the P-NOiSE Festival (A cultural exchange of Filipino Arts, Music, Dance and Film), which was mentioned in CNN, and has taken place across Copenhagen, Paris and Manila, supporting local and International artists.

With releases on Virgin Records, SONY, Kontor Records, as well as credible house music labels including Kingstreet, Simma Black, Tinted, Ibadan, Blacksoul, Milk & Sugar, Andy Roda continues to soar to new heights with his own label, ALIGN Records.

Their records ""Affenstunde"" (1971) and ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" (1972), played with the Moog III Synthesizer, are claimed to be fundamentally influencing works in Electronica. They went down in the annals of German film music history with their soundtracks for legendary cinema classics like ""Aguirre"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Nosfeartu"" and ""Cobra Verde"" by German film director Werner Herzog. 

In the light of a current rediscovery of the 1970s Ambient- Electronica and German Progressive Rock movement featuring bands like Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze or Harmonia, Popol Vuh is now the 2nd band, being remixed by today´s Electronica avant-garde, including treats by Stereolab, Mouse on Mars, Peter Kruder (Kruder & Dorfmeister), Thomas Fehlmann (The Orb), Moritz von Oswald, A Critical Mass, Alex Barck (Jazzanova), Roland Appel, Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), and Haswell & Hecker. 

 Many thanks to the great interest and the great mixes by all of the above.

""Let the Music Move You . . .""

For over 30 years UNCLE DOG has been djaying and producing records in europe and around the world. Born and raised in London he was surrounded from an early age by every type of musical influence appealing to his hightened sensitivity.
As the house movement was born in europe Filippo was already djaying with pioneers such as Paul Anderson, Dave Dorrell, C.J. Mackintosh, Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold in the capital's underground ""temples"", Heaven, The Wag, Cafe de Paris, Enter the Dragon, Subterrania, Westworld, Sunrise, Future and even in MK's and the Sound Factory in New York and Pacia in Ibiza, Sharm el Sheik, Barcelona and Madrid.  He produced records for Virgin 10, Phonogram and FFRR under the name of The Universal Funk Industry and Love Inc.
In the early nineties he became jaded by the overcommercialisation of the underground house scene which he so loved and decided to move to Italy where he layed low until the new millenium when he decided to start djaying and producing again.

He works as a dj in Italy and Spain appreciated for his respect of quality dance music and his understanding of the underground music scene.  
His DJ sets ar transmitted regularly on Radio DeeJay, the most famous radio station in italy.

Empro und Sven sind zwei Prachtexemplare, die sich vor nicht all zu langer Zeit erst gefunden haben. Empro ist DJ und unterhält einige einschlägige Tanzveranstaltungen, wie die Home-Sweet-Home-Party in Berlin und den Sleepless-Floor auf dem Melt!-Festival. Sven äugt dagegen virtuos und leidenschaftlich durch sein Ableton-Arrangement-Fenster und kann sich das Auflegen deswegen schon nicht verkneifen. Gott sei Dank, dass er das auch sehr gut beherrscht. Beide sind sich wohl in einem Bar25-Sommer näher gekommen, während gemeinsamen Marathon-DJ-Sets und beim sich gegenseitig Konfetti in die Unterhosen stecken. Dabei muss ihnen die kongeniale Sonne aufgegangen sein, die das Produkt „Empro & Jozwiak“ so erfreulich gedeihen lässt. Soundfreak Sven pflanzt hier ertragreiche Drum-Machines in Empros fruchtbaren Studiokompost, dessen Zentrum sich mit seismographisch nachvollziehbaren Basswellen über den Prenzlauer Berg erhebt und im anliegenden Upon-You-Büro für freundlich schielende Gesichter sorgt. Fleißige Geistesschwaden verhängen hier die Tageszeiten, Subfrequenzen drehen die Neonröhren aus der Fassung und am Ende kommt bei den beiden dann ein neues Liedchen raus.

I started producing music on an Ensoniq EPS Sampler in my teens by sampling sounds to create my own sounds and had so much fun on that syth/ sampler. Then later moved to the computer world of using Logic and later Abeton Live which I use as my main studio software. My main instrument of choice is keyboards/ piano which is where it started back when I was 3 and what I use for my midi recording. Yet I have also been a past metal and grunge guitar extraordinaire, okay not exactly, but that's what some kids at school used to say, so I'm going with it! And been known to surprise peeps with my drumming skills. 

I've also been DJing for a darn long time when Turntables were the only option, so I prefer the real vinyl feel of DJing music where possible and use Traktor Scratch Pro so I can play any tune using timecode vinyls which feel so darn real, yet also DJ with CDJs and USB set ups and using Traktor. I've DJed at clubs, radio stations, Raves, underground events, Conventions and house parties which happen to be my fav events to play at cos they are smaller and fun and often such like minded people where the funniest stuff happens and if the floor boards are making your turntables jump from all the happy dancing, everyone thinks it's part of the set. ;)

I have created music for software, video games, DJ mixes and various other media. I have a dream of making music for animation as in something you would see on tv, on Netflix or something bigger than You Tube. Must make that happen!"	86	6	0	2	5	0	2020-09-03T07:05:17Z	2008-01-01T02:59:45Z	False

Solomon isn’t your everyday magician. He doesn’t know how to pull a white rabbit out of a hat or your 6 of Clubs from the deck. But what the Bay Area-based music wizard can do is ELEVATE you on the dance floor. This was clear from the time of his first gig in ’89, when he used nothing more than a tape deck and cd player to transform a middle school prom into a raging pre-adolescent night club that terrified the chaperones. Ever since, he’s spread his innovative sound in clubs from here to China.
Solomon’s specialty is something he always called “Pop Turntablism.” It’s a niche of music that fuses scratching, beat juggling, word play, and live remixing with an eclectic mix of funk, soul, hip hop and rock tracks. It’s an emerging genre now popularly known as “Mashup.” And within this community, Solomon shines. As a producer, he was among an elite group of djs and producers comprising the Crooklyn Clan Vault. The website has become one of the main distribution hubs for dj mashups and has become an invaluable tool for promoting Solomon’s unique and original production sound.
His musical stylings have captured the imagination of some of today’s biggest music stars and he’s recently performed with The Black Eyed Peas, Digital Underground, De La Soul, Ozomotli, Groove Collective, Jurassic 5, Lyrics Born, Patti Labelle, DJ AM and Dan the Automator – just to name a few. And naturally, he’s caught the eye of club promoters everywhere. Solomon has residencies all over the Western US. From San Fran to Sacto, San Diego to Scottsdale. And last year, he teamed up with singer/songwriter Chris Clouse for an insanely popular Thursday night show at the Hard Rock Hotel. The LV Weekly raved that it was “Vegas’ Best Kept Secret.” They’ve brought the party back to SF where they tear down the walls every Wednesday night at the super chic subterranean lounge, Slide. And in case you don’t like waiting in long lines outside a club he’s spinning at, you can always just buy a ticket to a Golden State Warriors home basketball game. Solomon has been the team’s resident dj for the past six years, responsible for elevating the fans’ spirits when the team sinks to new lows. Sounds like a job for a magician indeed.

As comfortable in the world of Italo-disco and new-beat as he is at the mixing desk producing dense doom-metal soundscapes, the NTS resident has a back catalogue of music that weaves effortlessly between face-melting techno, acid, industrial and the indefinable.

With numerous dance-floor focused EPs and singles on labels ranging from Honey Soundsystem Records to Fred P’s Soul People Music; his albums 'Black Body Radiation' on Skudge White and 'Death Drums' on Ossia’s No Corner both received critical acclaim whilst exploring techno’s more peripheral and weirdo industrial edges.

Away from dance-floors his Spritiflesh project / live band with Bristol’s Borai, explores the dark spaces between post-punk, drone-metal and industrial power-electronics in what RA described as a ""phantasmagorical trip into the duos own musical universe"" for their debut album on No Corner.  Also known for their visceral and confrontational live shows, Julian's voice leads you through a truly un-nerving and cathartic sonic experience of percussive tropical drums, bass guitar and nightmarish noise displaying his range as an artist. 

These influences obviously run much deeper than contemporary electronic music scenes, as well evidenced in Sacred Pools, his monthly slot on NTS Radio where you're just as likely to hear death metal, doo-wop or pop as you are club music. His two-hour show delves into his record collection that defies genre and spans decades. 

His eclectic mixes for Crack Magazine, Boiler Room and Stamp the Wax show October as an adventurous club DJ without adhering to trends; delivered in a timeless narrative that gels the past and future seamlessly without loosing sight of making bodies move.
Through this ethos - Julian's lucky enough to have performed in most continents, and institutions such as Fabric and Berghain have both invited him back several times after his genre defying selections proved him the type of DJ comfortable building an event with considered selections or stepping up at peak time. His regular bookings by the widely respected Freerotation and Honey Soundsystem, have both led to offers of on-going DJ residences. With more releases on Honey Soundsystem and a sophomore album forthcoming; 2020 will be noisier than ever for the Chameleonic entity that is October.

The crowd respond at every turn."" - Steve McLay, DJ MAG
Always sitting slightly off-centre, Jay Tripwire is an artist that walks the line as industry staple and ever changing innovator,
releasing one standout release after another.
His signature fusion of deep Detroit textures and intricate rhythms has led a career spanning two decades,
with over 200 vinyl releases, 2 commercial mixed cd compilations, and four full length albums.
He remains one of the most prolific artists around, with an average of 15 releases per year.
He is an always an in demand remixer he averages 10-15 remixes per year.
In 2010 Jay Was honoured by being named by Future Music alongside Frankie Knuckles, Larry Heard, Charles Webster,
Atjazz, and Tom Middleton as being one of the most influentual Innovators in house music for “The thoughtful minimal stylings of Jay Tripwire.”
Most recently he’s completed a compilation mix for Steve Bug’s respected label Pokerflat –
‘Shaping Elements Vol.8’ which features a blend of deep house ranging from
Detroit inspired textures to modern European house and tech house fusions,
blurring genrefication. This follows releases on the label under his 8Channels name - a project that melds basic channel,
cosmic soul and dub into a new hybrid soundscape of techno, deep house and dub.
The moniker also appears on other highly regarded labels such as Ransom Note, Conya, NRK, Cinematic and Hallucination.
Whilst the term ‘legendary’ is often bandied about with little thought,
in Jay’s case we could say just that - his personal arsenal of re-edits and comfort in arranging extended DJ sets lasting eight hours or
more certainly demonstrates a talent that deviates from standard fare.
Jay also still supports,buys and plays vinyl, and actively seeks out records to play at gigs, when Tripwire is on the decks he plays a vinyl
and CD set.
Jay has made appearances in over 200 cities worldwide, and some of his most memorable gigs have been a decade of bookings at
Fabric London- a venue that has changed his approach to Djing, and production sound.
Jay’s work has been featured on numerous compilations, notably from Cocoon, Fabric, Renaissance, Journeys by DJ, Ultra & Bedrock,
and is supported by a diverse spectrum of dance culture from house luminaries
such as, Doc Martin and Kerri Chandler to techno legends Steve Bug and Laurent Garnier and John Digweed
With anticipated releases and remixes imminent, the Tripwire production wheel is still very much in motion,
and on its way to a turntable near you.

My dear Friends,
we have been active on Soundcloud for 12 years now. Since the first beta we supported this wonderful project. Unfortunately Soundcloud has changed a lot. Since there are no more groups To us SC feels like frozen. The advertising is more annoying than on Spotify - even though we pay  for it!  Our visitors are mostly good old Friends. Most of them - like on reverbnation - are also musicians. Don't get me wrong, SC is a great Place to communicate with other musicians but not so much for promotion nowadays.
. 
Many of you spend a lot of time and energy in collecting likes and comments here - but what for if no ""real"" listeners come by? You work for soundcloud many hours a month, pay for it and have to listen to their addspots, too - crazy!
Soundcloud is offering a monetization similar to Spotify for a while now, when you become a pro-member. However, you need at least 1000 plays a month and come from the ""right"" country to participate and only a few reach that number every month.

We have compared the number of  plays for some of our current tracks:

Cum Ex on SC 686 on Spotify 4131
Cum Cum on SC 393 on Spotify 3792
Farewell Fiji Islands on SC 2151 on Spotify 7944
Diversity Disappears on SC 3603 on Spotify 8309
Farmers on Fetanyl on SC 2252 on Spotify 7670

Please compare yourself: Tuh Pa Warez (maybe u need the free app to see stats) https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oJjFUCpoinLtJrCIpy7aw?si=tl0dgcMdQlmBWpp0M42rQA 

Our plan: We bring you all to Spotify - for free :-) 
There you can see how much potential your tracks really have. You will automatically get your own account and can see how often you have been heard and how many follow you.

Normally that costs money, so we give you the opportunity to remix our tracks here. We then upload them to Spotify with you as featured artist and you'll get a passive account there, which you can turn into an active one anytime you feel your tracks are well received.

So happy remixing!

Leitstrahl were raised on a strict diet of electronic music. Electro pop. Italo Disco. Synth movie scores. This was the bread and butter of this three man Austrian outfit.

Marcus Schneider combines synthesizer, piano, guitar, beats and occasionally vocals to create songs that each tell their own stories.
In a deeply emotional, sometimes melancholic, but also hopeful way, the individual components are melded into rather less mass-produced tracks.

Energetic and exciting, his dj sets invite to a journey between Chicago, Detroit and New York.

He regularly plays with the greatest and is also resident at audio (Cargography), Geneva.
His 90’s house style subtly flirting with deep, dub and raw techno sounds.

In the Spring of 1999, he started working as an editor at De:Bug magazine, while also writing for other magazines and newspapers.

As a DJ, he has been a club fixture since the early 2000s, holding residencies at various locations throughout the city and playing regularly at Berghain/Panorama Bar since its inception. He is and has been touring extensively as a DJ, playing hot spots like Concrete in Paris, Robert Johnson in Offenbach, fabric in London or Golden Pudel in Hamburg, as well as festivals like Glastonbury, Nation of Gondwana, Fusion, Garbicz or Melt!. Currently he can be regularly found behind the decks at Heideglühen and STAUB.

He has released various house and techno records both solo and in groups on labels like Spencer Parker's Work Them Records, Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control, John Osborn's Dred Records and his own labels Expansion Unit and Constant Variables. Sven von Thülen has remixed (solo and in groups) A-list DJs/producers like DJ Hell, Ellen Allien or Radio Slave. He continues to work as a DJ, producer and writer.

He co-wrote (alongside Felix Denk) the oral history Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno und die Wende, an in-depth look at the beginnings of Berlin's techno scene in the late eighties and early nineties, which was published in March 2012 by renowned German publisher Suhrkamp. In 2013 a French translation was published, and in October 2014 Sven von Thülen and Felix Denk self-published an English translation called Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno and the Fall of the Wall, followed by a translation into Spanish in November 2015. A Russian translation will be published in late 2019.

The book was turned into a TV documentary called ""Wendeklang""/""In This Place Called Techno"", for which Sven von Thülen co-wrote the script. He also curated the soundtrack, which featured two of his own original compositions. The documentary was aired on French-German TV station ARTE in July 2014. 

In August 2020 he released his debut album Emanating on Dred Records.

Atnarko is considered a legend of the underground house music scene in the south. He is known for his DJ sets that extend into the wee hours of the morning, taking adventurous partygoers deep into his musical den.

He also produced some of the early breaks records that defined the genre as it was emerging. These include the classic, “Tunnel Vision,” cited as an early influence by Maceo Plex, among others. As his career developed, he went on to produce many records and moved into other genres, most notably house and techno. With close to 200 releases appearing on a wide variety of labels, Atnarko’s paw prints are firmly planted in dance music.

His label, Infiltr8:Celebr8, continues to set the pace for underground events in Orlando, booking dance music friends and heroes with great success, expanding, and elevating the city’s culture. He continues to walk this path, playing and producing music he loves, regardless of boundaries. Atnarko has told his musical story far and wide over his long career and he would love to tell it to you."	7776	1003	0	185	93	28	2021-09-22T17:32:44Z	2008-02-28T16:51:47Z	True

still, i have been writing new material steadily since the band was last active, and i plan to use this outlet to promote music old and new as it gets recorded and produced.

expect a mix of songs and instrumentals influenced from progressive rock and which have been written for Poligraf, singer-songwriter tunes that are closer in their essence to folk-rock or even pop, pieces for solo classical guitar, and occasional electroid experimentation. hope you enjoy the ride !"	1528	1681	0	26	27	1	2020-02-07T16:34:40Z	2008-02-28T23:27:14Z	False

He may live in Paris, but don’t call him French. Journalist by day, DJ/producer by night, Faskil hails from none other than the culture-rich Belgium. There are no superhero tales to tell of a “child star” or “music wonderkid”, but if you have to be born with the talent, then perhaps it took Faskil a little while to realize what great potential was about to be unleashed when he started to tinker with his toys…

Like most great tales, this one began on a rainy day sitting inside in front of the computer. And as one (generally) does, Faskil decided to play around with some trackers he had on his PC. Turning some (digital) knobs and fiddling with some (once again digital) buttons, he began to realize that he might have just been on to something! And the rest is history.

Well maybe not, but in 1995 he teamed up with El Borbah to form the duo of Bump & Grind. It didn’t take them long to sign a deal with Exit Records, and over the years our ears were graced with not just one, but three albums. They were very well received throughout the electronic music community, particularly due to the way they blended lush soundscapes with the more eccentric sounds of modern electronic.

2005 saw the emergence of Faskil as a solo entity rather than as a member of Bump & Grind, and it didn’t take long for him to become somewhat of a cult favorite amongst the devoted fans of progressive house. His solo work has been picked up by labels such as Panda Recordings, Silk Records, microCastle Music, Triptik, Frisky Records, and Polytechnic Recordings. Aside from original productions, Faskil has lent his hand to remixing a wide range of artists, from the likes of Orbital, Luca Ricci, Derek Howell, Mango and Burufunk, to Harland and Gemma Hayes – every single work gaining praise from all corners of the globe.

Faskil is also a member of Snowgaze, a more downtempo oriented project with his friend Chrisman and has recently re-activated his electronica band BNG.

Aside from producing and remixing (and also being an uber-cool journalist), Faskil launched the Connected parties in Paris, with his friends Birdy & Boombatcha, hosted a successful monthly show on Frisky Radio titled “Silly Waffles” from 2008 to 2014 and is now producing a monthly podcast called “Blended & Baked”. He seems unstoppable, right? Well he might just be…

She lived in Ibiza for two seasons and was based in Berlin for 6 years whilst producing music, holding quarterly Wednesday event at Watergate, and working for Beatport and Native Instruments.

In 2014, Owen lived in the Maldives holding a 3 month residency at W Hotel. Performing on this beautiful island surrounded by palmtrees and crystal clear waters inspired her transition and discovery into new and old genres beyond House and Techno bringing back her original love for Trip Hop, Acid jazz and experimental music.

After years of crafting her styes and being inspired by natured the new project 'Mochelle' was created. Mochelle combines a mix of warm, laid back vibes through chill, electronic, funk n’ soul, and nu-disco. Creating the perfect soundscape for any environment, nature is the biggest inspiration. 

Mochelle can be found playing 100-115 bpm vibes under a palm tree, by a pool, on the beach or in the snowy mountains."	11760	526	0	179	607	9	2021-03-28T22:08:27Z	2008-02-29T21:46:00Z	True

1659	tiimko	tim	koch	tim koch	Adelaide	https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-KRrOTuTuacir9Ecy-XLGkKA-large.jpg	6	42	"Australian producer Tim Koch started early, experimenting with a Tascam reel-to-reel four track, an endless supply of his siblings’ guitars, and a few 8-bit computer systems. An early fascination with 1978-1981-era Public Image Ltd. – especially Metal Box’s stark production and behemoth basslines – led Koch to play bass guitar and drums in a number of shoegaze-influenced rock bands. He soon developed a taste for more instrumental, sequencer-based music, drawn to its potential for experimentation and unorthodox sound sources. While studying at Adelaide University, Koch took advantage of the University’s EMU music-technology unit, surrounding himself with archaic analogue synthesizers and listening deeply to innovative composers like Varese, Stockhausen, and Ligeti.

Over five full-length albums, Tim Koch has explored countless moods and textures but never tied himself to one style. He initially found the attention of the electronic-music world

under the moniker Thug, layering Detroit-style pawn-shop beatboxes with rich synth pads; on subsequent releases, he reverted to his given name and toyed with more playful sounds. Koch’s recent full-length Faena refines all the elements of his career thus far while integrating acoustic guitars, female vocals, and raw found sounds. Over the years, the Adelaide-based Koch has released his music on labels including deFocus, Merck, U-Cover, Seeland, n5MD, and Intr_version and has composed for film, television, and video games.

Regarding 10:32, his newest project on Ghostly International, Koch’s remarks are as cryptic as his choice of moniker:

10:32 is the length of an albatross.
10:32 is a month and an age.
10:32 is soft skin on hollow hearts.
10:32 is quick feet on cool floors.
10:32 is seeing through your eyes.
10:32 is mornings into evenings.
10:32 is finishing before the end.
10:32 is ten thirty-two."	1204	674	0	81	94	7	2020-07-30T15:44:12Z	2008-03-04T03:48:43Z	False

Jeremy Bible is an award winning film maker, composer and interdisciplinary artist focused on the intersection of sound and light. Taking cues from his background in field recording and photography, his work occupies a shared space between multi-channel audio-visual installation and compositional practice. Utilizing acousmatic sonic diffusion techniques, Bible strives to construct an environmental experience that is at turns profoundly sensory and beautifully surreal.

Through a fusion of angular electronics and immersive ambience, Bible invites listeners to explore an eco-futurist environment that challenges the established topographies of time and linearity. His sculptural soundtracks range in tone from meditative to jarring, creating a dynamic accompaniment to the visual components of each performance. As long, lingering shots of sweeping landscapes and panoramic vistas merge into one another, Bible’s sound design helps us see these familiar terrestrial forms in a renewed and alien light.

Bible’s works have been presented at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Moscow Museum of Modern Art, Akron Art Museum and MOCA, as well as numerous other events, galleries and festivals over the course of his 20-year creative activity."	31138	2002	0	6123	52	715	2020-09-10T21:23:24Z	2008-03-05T20:51:00Z	False

She enjoys going out of bounds in selecting unique tracks and sharing them with like-minded music lovers. Her versatility in dance music is undeniable as she can deliver House, Deep House, Techno-Soul, Acid, Tribal, Afro, Soulful, and rare Classics.

RIVKA grew up listening to House Music since 1986. Her biggest influences are artist such as Larry Heard, Todd Terry, Frankie Knuckles, and DJ Disciple. Surrounded by DJ’s most of her life, it was inevitable that aside from expressing herself through dance, she was meant to tell her own musical journey.

RIVKA began by telling her own stories through online radio shows such as Downshift Radio, Frisky Radio, NYC House Radio to name a few, and also held down residencies on Pre-Party Radio, and SSRadio UK Deep & Soulful back in 2006 till 2009.

As RIVKA’s reputation evolved in the nightlife, she's had opportunities in playing at popular events with artist such as Vince Watson, Joe Claussell and Joey Anderson at the Golden Record event (Bogart House), Hex Hector at TOCA (Cielo), Tony Humphries (Bar 13), Tony Touch (FunkBox NYC), Anańe (NYC DEEP), Jacky Sommer & Kat Smith (Analog Soul), DJ Disciple (FEEL REAL), Joseph Valentin (Republic Music), and Mr. V (Sole Channel) to name a few.

Currently, RIVKA has released her own music, and you can check it out on Bandcamp, Beatport, Apple Music, Spotify, and more streaming sites."	1035	255	0	102	129	11	2021-10-30T13:21:57Z	2008-03-06T04:38:05Z	False

His style is heavily influenced by breakbeat, electro and triphop. But elements from jazz, rock and movie scores, computer games, classical choir singing and even the ’80s can also be found in his songs.
Everything is wonderfully blended together into a typical mockmoon meltingpot: rich, layered music that invites you to dream.
The number ‘Ganymede’ for example, reminds you of the threatening atmosphere of woods and wolves, ‘The Great White Open’ of a spooky ánd jazzy dark sea shore and the lighter ‘Anemone’ sounds faerylike and lovely.
Every song is complex and organic and can best be described as dark fairytales with a happy ending. (JK)"	481	1883	0	27	20	0	2020-11-16T09:18:47Z	2008-03-09T17:58:03Z	False

C'est en 1995 que Jan Bess contracte le virus de la techno, en tombant par hasard sur le classique Don't Laugh de Josh Wink. Trois ans plus tard, il acquiert ses premières platines. En 2007, il sort son premier morceau Carnivalium sur le maxi Musique Plaisir EP, sorti sur le label hollandais Stolen Moments et s'installe en Nouvelle-Calédonie. Il participe à l'organisation de nombreuses soirées au sein de plusieurs associations locales, ce qui l'amène à jouer aux côtés d'artistes qui, depuis des années, sont pour lui autant de sources d'inspiration : Carl Cox, Paul Nazca, Tonio, Noisebuilder, Maxime Dangles, Salva Pascalidis, ou encore Woody Mc Bride. Aux platines, spontanéité et empathie sont ses maîtres mots, pour se mettre en état de communion avec les danseurs, les plonger dans un état de transe propice au voyage, et ne plus les lâcher jusqu'à destination."	1449	1861	0	110	106	9	2021-08-06T22:50:20Z	2008-03-10T00:05:17Z	False

We now are RV’ers and are enjoying our ‘Bare Roots’. 
My favorite artist Steven Wilson was a major inspiration on me throughout the months under attack. deadmau5 also kept me inspired and focused. 
I hope you enjoy the EP and find something useful for yourself in it.

1771	Sonar Kollektiv	NULL	NULL	NULL	Berlin	https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-x2XoZBU59SRbMkQx-0IOypA-large.jpg	87	651	"Sonar Kollektiv was founded in 1997 by Jazzanova. Designed as a platform for own releases it soon attracted numerous new discoveries and like-minded musicians to lead their trumps right here. Still it was never the intention of Sonar Kollektiv to pursue one specific sound or provide an already existing scene. Each and every release on the label (250 and counting) was at all times meant to illustrate the musical taste of the collective, its flavourful development and recollection of past sounds. The various compilations and label showcases played a big part of it. From the renowed „Secret Love“ compilation (No. 6 will be released these days), the „Computer Incarnations For World Peace“ edition, the  „...Boadcasting“ and „....Mixing“-series to the „Romanian Jazz“ label showcase Sonar Kollektiv continuously cares about broadening its own and the horizon of any type of music lovers. How broad this horizon can be expanded showed the release of Âme’s „Rej“ in 2005. Shorthandly minimal techno was redifined and at the same time the sublabel Innervisions (runned by Dixon) was leveraged to worldwide fame. Other milestones in the eventful history of Sonar Kolletiv were the discovery of the New Zealand reggae soul combo Fat Freddy’s Drop (2005), the debuts by Micatone (2003), Benny Sings (2005), Clara Hill (2003) and Eva Be (2004), the first releases by Dimlite (2003), Tricksi (2006), Christian Prommer’s Drumlesson (2007), as well as Georg Levin (2005) and his collaborative project with Dixon, Wahoo (2004). Also for some of today’s legends of more sophisticated electronic music, like Ulrich Schnauss, Ben Klock and Marcin Kozlowski (now a member of Whitest Boy Alive) Sonar Kollektiv offered a stepping stone to their international careers. And in 2003 a certain Eric Wahlforss released his first record here, just before founding Soundcloud.

When at the end of 2009 the rate of fire ceased some thought the label is running on empty or lost touch to contemporary sounds. But the releases of this year so far should prove doubters wrong. The remix album „Jazzanova Upside Down“ (released in January) gathers the who’s who of the currenty most happening and game-changing DJs and producers (Henrik Schwarz, Motor City Drum Ensemble, Filippo Moscatello, Manuel Tur, Mark E, and more) to catapult Jazzanova classics into the future. By signing Phil Gerus from Moscow, the new project Hot Coins out of the UK, EnaWadan from South Africa and the pan-Geman duo Paskal & Urban Absolutes four of the most promising new acts slantingly offside the dancefloor have been added to the already impressive roster. And once again all true pop aficionados with an addiction for soul and a genuine craft in songwriting are pierced to the heart with the brand new albums by FETSUM („The Colors Of Hope“) and Micatone („Wish I Was Here“).

But what is the formula of success of the Berlin based label? A dance music imprint that – with a few exceptions – actually doesn’t release club music? Is it even after all exactly this? Delievering music for prior to, succeeding and one day after a club night?

There’s no other German record label that can boast such an adventurous range of styles: reggae, folk, electronica, jazz, funk, calypso, house, techno and now also chillwave, dubstep, dream pop, and so on. At Sonar Kollektiv there’s somehow room for everything. Still, all of the 250 and counting releases have one common denominator: It’s music made out of passion - without any financial aim or attemps of ingratiation. From and for music lovers."	49673	156	0	120	16	14	2021-11-05T11:47:31Z	2008-03-11T22:46:00Z	True

Like many projects of a certain age it frustrates attempts at pat summation. It began after Burke drew from Throbbing Gristle’s farewell concerts the impetus to make sound his vehicle for confrontation, self-discovery, connection, and transcendence. Releasing over 30 full length records, tapes, and CD’s on Complacency, Odd-Size, Staalplaat, Tesco, Silent, Soleilmoon, Korm Plastics, Experimedia, Waystyx, Drone, and No Part Of It. Performing over 300 live concerts throughout Europe and the states. Notable performances include No Fun 2008, the Wroclaw Industrial Music Festival 2009, Sonic Circuits in 2010, and In collaboration with Shen Wei Dance Arts in 2011, for his work Still Moving, Burke performed live at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC with a six channel surround system. Their music is the terra incognita where sound, silence, noise and music intersect. Using conventional instruments, sound generating devices and random objects, IOS hews sonic sculptures that deliberately provoke, mesmerize and confront listeners. Outside of IOS Burke has collaborated with Jon Mueller, Randy Greif, Darin Gray, Z’EV, Cheer-Accident, Jim O'Rourke, Thomas Dimuzio, Kevin Drumm, Jeff Jerman, Eric Lunde, Bill Horist, Al Margolis, Olivia Block, Travis Bird, and others. From 2013-2016 he had a radio show called  “Patchworks”  incorporating many historical official releases as well as the output of many citizens of the Muffwiggler forum, snippets of demos, interviews, dialog, and live modular performances on WNUR at Northwestern University. The IOS collaboration with Z”EV (R.I.P.) from 2008-2010 is finally being released on vinyl later this year on No Part of It in conjunction with Drone, Korm Plastics, and other labels. In 2014 the game of life web label published “Modern Magic” by Soundoferror, Burke’s alias for new electronic and synthesizer based music. He has just posted the album “Focused Systems Approach #2 {Aalto} >Sleep Shapes” on the website.
He has recently been studying piano and has started a site for new more musical endeavors that is not specifically of an experimental/electronic/synthesis nature called FINITE MATERIAL CONTEXT which will also present some of the many past collaborations that were never previously published.
The most recent new IOS work is Burke’s forthcoming session 32 submission to the Modularisme program called “Focused Systems Approach #1 {Buchla/Euro} >Margins of Error”. A new Buchla format composition featuring a Euroblade adapter with the incomparable Mungo Do delay. The included companion video album “Visions of Error” was a series of live grabs made with the iPhone while laying down these tracks then processed with the Synthetic software Studio Artist 5 software."	514	88	0	27	41	1	2020-10-27T20:47:26Z	2008-03-12T18:16:00Z	False

His ever-restless creativity and desire to build a platform for music that defines the deeper side of the electronic spectrum, led Alex to launch his very successful label, AEON in 2013 – an imprint which has gone on to play an integral part in building Alex’s impressive repertoire of releases to this point and beyond. His aim for the label is to build a representative artistic platform that mirrors the peak time DJ sets that he plays, referencing the spirit of classic, timeless house and techno and updating it for the future.	73703	294	0	70	15	15	2021-07-13T12:51:00Z	2008-02-11T18:10:06Z	True

Soon he started creating his own tunes mostly based on 303 sequences by building up a midi-studio with his friends Dr. Nick & J in the early 90ies.

After releasing some four to the floor “12”s on several labels based in the “Taunus-Area”, they decided to get the focus more on their second love: Ambient Music. Therefore Phonosynthese was founded in 1995. Until today, Lebenstrom and Waldall are still two beautiful and timeless Ambient Longplayer released on Elektrolux 2002 and 2005.

These days Mr.Rod is back on the Dancefloor as he is responsible for the resident Sound in the Level 6 Club in Darmstadt. With Paul Brtschitsch and Malte he released the “12” “Grow” on Resopal including Remixes by Jackmate and Marek Hemann and with his longtime friend Alex Azary he starts a cooparation together with Shayde, a project of his DJ friend Phillip Lenz (Delenz) and Richard Hœtter, who will celebrate their debut with the track „Jupiter Swing“ on the legendary label Connaisseur Recordings in 2017.

He is part of the Rootknox family and showing his “hyperactive” creativity while he is Dj, Producer, Artist and responsible for almost every video made for Paul´s releases on Rootknox yet. His DJ Sets are showing a variety of electronic styles, you never will get beeing bored as a dancer, meanwhile Mr Rod is behind the decks!"	267	134	0	236	18	8	2021-01-28T14:12:34Z	2008-02-11T22:39:46Z	False

I love Disco and all related styles like Deep House or Funk, Soul, Boogie. But hey stay away with typical ""Berlin"" techno...not that I dislike Techno in general. I like it, not as much as house, but i definitely like it. However I am pretty bored with that ""Berlin"" sound right now. 

I work in the music industry/worked in the games industry and think of my DJ-ing as a hobby I get paid for and where I am able to play the music I love. However I would happily greet any kind of bookings and ways to somewhat professionalise it. So if you think I should spin at your party, send me a line. 

Check my Soundcloud (User MrMire) or my MixCloud pages for recent mixes. 

Anyway if you want to get in contact with me, do so! If you make a reasonable offer, I'm pretty sure we can make a deal."	204	203	0	88	10	5	2019-04-09T19:35:30Z	2008-02-13T14:03:44Z	False

As the first DJ to mix live on the eminent BBC music show Top Of The Pops, he’s helped bring techno to the widest audience possible. As the man behind Meganite – one of Ibiza’s most successful and longest running nights – he has recruited some of the world’s most respected underground DJs as residents; Adam Beyer, Marco Carola and Chris Liebing.

This journey to legendary status began over 25 years, 700 releases and 7 million unit sales ago when he became the first Italian finalist in the world DMC championships in 1988. Galvanising this success the following year with a win on a live broadcast Italian DJ competition called The Walky Cup, his national crown as a premiership DJ was realised... And the world beckoned.

A string of sonic successes, dancefloor dominance and industry victories followed; early chart appearances as R.A.F and co- writing for myriad European house acts during the early 90s led him to become a partner Media Records, while his reptilian trilogy in 1998 elevated him to a global level; ‘Lizard’, ‘Iguana’ and ‘Komodo (Save A Soul)’ fused trance with techno on such a level they became hymns for the biblical superclub explosion during the last few years of the 20th century and charted in many countries. From this point onwards, the world could no longer ignore the dance music and techno phenomenon. And Mauro was driving from the front. As one of the most in-demand artists across the globe, he barely left DJ Mag’s illustrious Top 100 DJ list throughout the first decade of the 21st century.

Constantly searching for innovative developments – both musically and technically – Mauro expressed an early vision that is now common place within electronic music: his ability to bring the underground to the masses, to fuse melody, hooks and harmony with industrial strength drum dynamics, his innate understanding of widescreen DJ selections that cover the whole spectrum created a reputation that positioned him in all corners of techno.

This focus and attitude meant that as a DJ he’s been invited to perform the broadest possible range of peaktime sets from Berlin’s famed Love Parade to Turin Winter Olympics via Timewarp, Tomorrowland, MTV Festival, Awakenings, Sensation, Mayday, Ultra Music Festival, Space Miami, Ibiza and thousands more. As an artist this gave him the freedom to flex from major remixes of top tier acts like Freddie Mercury and The Pet Shop Boys while delivering extensive albums that explore every side of techno with daring experimentation with tracks such as ‘Baguette’, ‘Contaminato’, ‘Hong Kong’, ‘The Riff’ and ‘Asteroids’.

As well as his journeyman DJ sets and full spectrum productions, this vision is also evident in his two brands. Both established in the early 2000s and still going strong to date, his Meganite events and Alchemy label are both melting pots for evolution and development. Meganite at Privilege is one of Ibiza’s most infamous techno parties and has since gone on to take over clubs and arenas across Europe and the US while Alchemy has delivered cuts from the likes of Adam Beyer, Chris Liebing, Joseph Capriati, Paco Osuna, Popof, Sasha Carassi, The Advent, Steve Rachmad, Nicole Moudaber and many more. Not just a label, Alchemy has also given the world a successful festival in Mauro’s motherland Turin in 2010 and is the home to his hugely popular podcast series that is syndicated across the world and listened to by audiences of millions.

The Dolphins are one of the most important names of the Italian dance scene. Group formed by 3 members - Alessandro Veneri, Cristiano Valentini, Giacomo Doglione, all with previous experiences - they started to team up in the year 2000.

In a few years the trio started to walk on its own legs and, thanks to a frenetic ""pass the word"" between the attendants created by the outset ""Rosemary"" on Sushi Records, Ivan Iacobucci wanted them for his Hole Subaltern Records. With this label they produced the explosive single ""House Panic"", after which they were required also by the famous American label Guidance Recording and the English Hooj Choons (that remixed a big such us Paul Woolford, Dexter and Inland Knights): ""House Panic"" has literally created panic in the international house chart, giving notoriety to the Italian crew. In year 2003 - with only two records produced - the combo recovered with lots of pressure and various labels were interested to their challenging electric mix, dance, techno and rock melodies: in one year, The Dolphins published their new single ""Knockin'Out"" and got to remix artist like Echomen, House Of Glass, Cincinnati, Cool Shop, Ajello and various others, imposing themselves like one of the most demanded names among the mixers of the Made In Italy school.

The year 2004 is characterized by the approach to the Italian Ocean Dark - sub label of Ocean Trax, label of the famous duo Bini&Martini - for which they became immediately on of the most important projects : in a short period, the Dolphins produce the singles ""This Is Our Show"", ""Pornographic"", Warriors""- confirming themselves as important productive reality.

During 2006 the ensemble has mixed the success of Bini&Martini ""Stop"" (gathering a big success in the Beatport chart) and the track ""Sentinel"" by Transglobal Underground. At the same time they reinforced their partnership with Ocean Dark and  published two ep's of remarkable success ""Base One"", ""Base Two"" and ""Monogram"", hits in the download charts, as well as records among the most important international scene for the label itself.

2007 has been a year of further growth : on one side The Dolphins has continued the activity for Ocean Dark, releasing the new e.p. called Minibox, on the other they have created a new liaison with Mantravibes, Mark Knight’s Toolroom Records (for which they have  remixed the hits ""My MTV"" by Noir and “Roadkill” by Dubfire ), Proton Music (Us), Noir Music (Dk) and Southern Fried ( UK - FatBoy Slim’s label).

2008 looks set to be a natural progression for The Dolphins and a year that was destined to bring them even greater success, and so they started on SCI+TEC Digital Audio (US_Dubfire's label) with two great tracks “Chemical Youth” and the  hit “Haze Hard” that brought the crew at the top of the most important international charts.

After this success they have worked  like remixers and producers for  Suara (ES), Lot 49 (UK), Boxer (DE), Erratom (Fr), Woh Lab (FR), Hell Yeah (I), Flash (DE), Neurotraxx (I) and more others labels.

Moreover, from 2009 to 2012 with others two massive releases on Sci+Tec, “When I’m Wrong”, and “Buffalo” and the last super HIT “Alba”, they continued the activity for Dubfire  and started a solid collaboration with 2 great germans labels: Affin (Joachim Spieth’s label) and Opossum rec (Marcel Jochmann's label).

At the same time, during these 10 years, a very intensive activity of dj-ing develops in the italian and european territory, in set that becomes exercise for live experiments , use of keyboards, tools and also vocal backings . In a period of great artistic/productive growth, The Dolphins develop a sound always more personal and challenging, mixing minimal influences and electronic, house melodies and techno rhythms, always considering an important dance floor, key element that has always characterized the crew's productions."	1651	193	0	48	5	3	2021-05-26T16:35:01Z	2008-02-21T13:13:37Z	False

Trial-and-error of different production techniques, some tool automation, logistical questions, budget, family affairs etc. shaped our way we're making Suspense Techno today.

Days, weeks, months, years passed by without changing our attitude towards the kind of music we love.

With the first releases from Trickski in 2005, it quickly became evident that this is not true for these guys. They fit into many drawers! Fans returning home with a new Trickski record habitually tear their hear in front of their shelves: Where is this one going? Techno? Yes. House? Definitely. Disco? Edits? Sure. Deep Slow Motion? Well, yeah! HipHop? Certainly. And Melodies? And Banging? And Deep? Okay, works for them. And still there is a clear trade mark sound that is just what makes Trickski so singular. 
Their openness to many sides has won them friends and critical acclaim very quickly, and so it went that the co-productions of Yannick Labbé and Daniel Becker as Trickski came to fill the record cases of international DJs across all genres. On top of that Carl Craig featured their first single „Sweat“ on his legendary Fabric 25 compilation, which gave Trickski‘s kick off an extra booth. 
From 2006 to 2008, the next step followed: Yannick and Daniel were in charge of  the limited series “Member of the Trick”. With the help of Berlin’s infamous Sonar Kollektiv, they published ten vinyl EP’s and one CD-compilation. The “kindred spirits” involved in this project were artists from the likes of Skwerl, early Solomun (head honcho of DIYnamic), Future Beat Investigators, Schmutzig de Mutzig or the duo Leroy & Darnell.
After extensive touring in 07 - 09 it got a little quiet around Trickski even though they released great 12“s on Future Classic and Chicago based Stilove4music. They attitude is rather to release less and and do this with all their love than putting one 12“ after the other on the market. During that time Trickski have also  been the resident DJs at their favorite Berlin club, “Cookies”, every third Tuesday of the month for the last two years, inspiring young women and music nerds alike to tear it up on the dance floor - sometimes with a special guests like Trevor Jackson, Eddie Fowkles, Solomun. Quarion, Glass Candy (live) or Rainer Trüby, and sometimes without one.
2010 Trickski found a new homebase: on one side it is Suol, run by their good friends and soulmates, Johnjon & Chopstick from Berlin and on the other hand it is the amazing SloHouse inprint Delusions of Grandeur from the UK. Both 12“s (The Warm up / DOG and After & Before / Suol) got amazing feedback. Their tune Pill Collins was even in the world wide top ten at Soundcloud in August 2010. 
In the first half of 2011 Trickski will finally release their long awaited debut album on Suol. On top of that there will be more slomo pump on DOG! Exciting!
Trickski released on labels like: Sonar Kollektiv, Compost Records, Compost Black Label, DIYnamic Music, Delusions of Grandeur, Defected, Suol, Stilove4music, Future Classic, Gigolo Recordings, Mood Music, Raw Fusion or Mina Recordings and djs at clubs like Cookies, Weekend, Watergate (Berlin), Fabric, The End (London), Goa (Madrid), Club 11 (Amsterdam), Dornroosje (Nijmegen) Zukunft (Zurich), Dada (Tel Aviv), APT (New York City), Electric Pickle (Miami) Civic Underground (Sydney), FFour (Melbourne), Gilles Peterson‘s Worldwide Festival (Singapore), Vega, Culture Box, (Copenhagen), F12, Kruthuset (Stockholm), Nouveau Casino, Batôfar (Paris), Sottomarino Giallo (Milan), and many more."	331019	246	0	57	215	5	2020-11-19T16:15:39Z	2007-07-30T22:18:00Z	True

While his many-sided body of work reaches back more than a decade, the Swedish producer’s current investigations in the field of experimental dance music are as prolific as they are unpredictable.

After a series of albums as Roll The Dice alongside Malcolm Pardon, he lent his production skills to Fever Ray’s acclaimed debut album and 2017’s Plunge and is currently busy exploring a new strain of techno-pop together with Pär Grindvik as Aasthma.

Working under his own name Mannerfelt’s sonic imprint can be most acutely felt. Accompanying  appearances on Voam, Hinge Finger, Numbers and more, he established his own label Peder Mannerfelt Produktions to carry the bulk of his output, and that of kindred spirits such as Klara Lewis, Code Walk and Sissel Wincent.

Peder Mannerfelt music is always rooted in the kinetic energy of techno even as it seeks to break down the genre’s rigid, illusory formulae."	37710	146	0	258	38	34	2020-12-16T20:57:56Z	2007-08-20T20:02:00Z	True

Carl Åborg who goes by the artist name Carl Borg is a Swedish producer, sound designer and film music composer.
Carl started making electronic music at the age of 14. He found his way into house music after buying a Yamaha A3000 sampler, sampling through his friends and parents vinyl collections. In 2004 he began to tour through Europe, South Africa and Russia together with Forss (Eric Wahlforss) as Forss Versus Borg. Playing live-sets consisting of both up-tempo house tracks and experimental glitchy electronica. Carls debut release, the classic 12 inch Splinter Body Scene EP, was released on German label Sonar Kollektiv during that same time. Since then he has released several EPs, remixes and produced a number of original soundtracks throughout the years. 
One of the soundtracks, Tasteology Soundtrack made for House of Radon in Stockholm, has today over 15 million streams on Spotify. With several tracks on the platforms largely popular playlists like Peace and Sleep.
Carl played an important part of the band project SFB, The Stoner + Forss + Carl Borg, a fusion of acoustic jazz and live electronica, in 2006. The project resulted in a number of live gigs around Sweden, and later the album The Lektor Tapes on Gothenburg based label Hoob Records.

Rubber Inc.

Formed late in 1998 by partners Malek Lopez and Noel de Brackinghe, Rubber Inc. successfully pioneered the concept of live dance music in the Philippines. Often confused with DJs the duo originally utilized an arsenal of keyboards, mixers,effects, samplers and sequencers to create music rather than relying upon records or CDs. Having gigged extensively throughout Manila as well as trips out of town to Cebu, Boracay and even Lucena the group have honed their skills to the often fussy markets of the Philippines with a very distinct sound that incorporates elements of techno, house, breakbeat, latin, drum n' bass and the more leftfield sounds of groups like Autechre and Aphex Twin. Not limiting themselves to the dancefloor Rubber Inc. have done numerous art gigs including performances at the CCP (Cultural Centre of the Philippines) sound design and soundtrack work for multimedia theatre and Ballet Philippines at the CCP. Additional production work has included several commercial projects like product launches and commercials, remixes and arranging for local singers. 2001 saw Rubber Inc. break away from the club scene to focus more on studio work; having setup Sweetspot Studios mid-year to cater to recording projects from local labels and unsigned bands as well as their own projects. Sweetspot has become a succesful production company over the years. With Malek focusing on scoring projects for television, film and art exhibits. Noel spent his time honing his skills as an audio engineer and has produced or engineered many highly acclaimed albums. Malek also formed a band 'Drip'; a female vocalist fronted band playing trip hop, drum and bass and everything in between. (dripmanila.multiply.com) Now with Sweetspot becoming a more stable entity and the addition of apprentices, Rubber Inc have found the time and motivation to start producing and gigging more extensively once again. With the years of studio experience and the advancements in music technology the band have a whole new set of tools and skills that has advanced the bands sound and production. 2007 sees them return to the music world full force gigging in Manila once again and being invited to play at the Co-Pop Festival in Cologne, Germany, with further collaboration with the Teichmann Brothers scheduled for later in the year."	369	26	0	2	2	0	2016-02-19T09:03:08Z	2007-08-30T21:24:37Z	False

But someday somebody has to do something that sounds like the teutonian answer to New Order, Stereolab, Fela Kuti  and Whitest Boy Alive. 

Being a solitary perfectionist, Rupert works incredibly slowly. But this could also be due to the fact that half-sleep is his greatest source of inspiration (see the somewhat confused lyrics). After two EPs on the long deceased netlabels iD.EOLOGY and Corpid and some nice remixes for Bobby Baby, Emily in Love and Forss, it took him several years to finally come around the corner with tracks for a new EP. Fortunately, in the meantime he has further reduced his fear of contact with songwriting and pop."	3348	30	0	42	36	5	2021-10-27T19:52:43Z	2007-09-13T22:26:14Z	False

Since then, she ha been on a constantly evolving musical journey. In the early years, her sound was rooted in techno and landed most often on the label Brouqade Records, which she established in 2007. The label is still running too, and celebrated its 10th Year Birthday Celebration entitled 'Past/Present/Future' that emphatically encapsulated all that's great about the label. 
Aside from Brouqade, Dana's music has also featured on the liked of Autoreply, Work Them Records, Howl and Underground Quality. It was Jus Ed's label where she released her stunning debut album. 'Naturally' in 2014, an LP that introduced Dana to a whole new audience and showcased her pure house sound with some distinctions. In 2017 she started her new Label 'Cave Recordings' that showcased her wide musical range mainly rooted in House with old school flavor. 
When she isn't busy in the studio crafting textured tracks, Dana is a fine DJ who holds down resident duties at top Berlin space, Club der Visionaere. It is there that she lays down seductive tracks from the worlds of house and techno as well as gems in between. Aside from her beloved CDV, Dana has played in some of the globe's foremost house and techno nightclubs, often alongside some of the scene's prime movers and shakers. 
Despite working in such an over saturated and competitive field, Dana Ruh manages to speak louder and more coherently that most, and for that reason she deserves all the love she gets."	25987	106	0	99	67	34	2020-09-23T19:35:40Z	2007-11-28T11:51:51Z	False

Starts to spin records from the autumn of 2005, joins Djmixes in 2006 as well as the Freakyhouse project in 2007. Also in that year together with In:Form they launch their radio show on Töréspont. The guys join the well known and much respected Tilos Radio in September 2008. Their show named Slow Down ended at 2020 November, and they started a brand new show at Tilos called 'Hangkelte' on every Sunday, between 6am-8am CET. In 2010 the BRP studio were established and from this year he has been primarily focusing on making music (famous Awakening of the nature track was made in this studio). Now focusing on his own home studio. His style is difficult to define, principally seeking for deeper house but always up for bringing jazzy, dubby or soul elements to his music."	835	692	0	882	255	88	2021-10-01T11:58:27Z	2007-11-28T12:56:24Z	False

Most of us come under the spell of the electronic cosmos sooner or later, but doing so at the tender age of 4 years rather seems highly exceptional. And even if this might appear almost impossible at first glance, this was indeed the case for young Christoph alias Click | Click, when he heard Kraftwerk for the very first time on the radio back then. Therefore, it is no surprise that this experience was going to change his life significantly.

His name thereby originates from his earliest musical roots when he was still forfeited to the more minimal sounds of Techno and in which time he also started his first own label Kassette Records in the year 2006. And even if much has happened since and a lot changed musically, Click | Click always remained true to his roots by keeping his name. Through his musical transformation from Minimal Techno to Jackin' House, also the labels changed in the course of time, on which we have been able to pursue his musical talent over the years.

In 2013, he already established his second labels Palms & Flamingos, meant to provide room for exactly such projects, which had developed over the years. Of course it did not take long, until many reputable labels of the scene got wind of his artistic refinement. Like this, Click | Click already put out numerous releases on imprints like Green Velvet/ Cajmere's Cajual, Shir Khan's Exploited Ghetto, Mihalis Safras' Label Mr. Carter/ Material and Riva Starr's Snatch! Records, which not only lead to countless chart positions on relevant platforms, but also caused further international interest in his music.

Productions like Teenage Killerfunkband (2010), Ducks In The Kiddie Pool (2013), Girls Girls Girls (2013), The Muzic Box (2015) or Birdhain (2017) made their way into the crates of scene pioneers like Magda, Jamie Jones, Green Velvet or Claude VonStroke. This diversified and respectable appreciation of his creative doing naturally provided him with numerous national and international performances in the best clubs and most important festivals of the world as well.

Like that, he already played in such reputable venues like the Watergate Berlin, Ministry of Sound London or D-Edge Sao Paulo, as well as the meanwhile relocated to Portugal BPM Festival Mexico or the Monarch/ Great Northern in San Francisco. Also his successfully completed tours through varying countries like Brazil, Mexico, USA, China, South Korea or Thailand make unmistakably clear, that the name Click | Click should not be forgotten too quickly."	14724	102	0	269	745	19	2020-12-16T21:19:06Z	2007-11-30T20:30:59Z	True

Will Saul has been at the cutting edge of electronic music for nearly 20 years now. He has released well over 150 records across his two labels - Aus Music & Simple Records - from the influential likes of Joy Orbison, Carl Craig, Pearson Sound, Leon Vynehall and Actress, as well as EPs that helped to break the careers of talents like Bicep, Dusky, Midland and George FitzGerald. This visceral A&R ability has seen him become head of A&R at !K7, responsible for all artist signings and in charge of curating the hallowed DJ Kicks series. Unearthing new and exciting artists and music is Will's lifeblood and something he has been doing every day for as long as he can remember. Will started working in music aged 19 - work experience during university led to a full time role as A&R with Sony Music. He left Sony to set up his first label Simple whilst becoming part of the team that founded the legendary Phonica Records in London.
As an artist in his own right his music and remixes have been critically acclaimed and seen him featured on the cover of DJ magazine and helm the Essential mix for Radio 1. Will has been trusted to remix a diverse range of incredible artists from Little Dragon to Kelis via Pearson Sound and Fink and has released many singles and EPs (on labels such as Kompakt and !K7 as well his own) as well as two full length artist albums - the last of which was his CLOSE project - which saw him tour a live audio visual show (with a drummer) which debuted in room 2 of Fabric.

Will is an experienced DJ and has held residencies at some of the best clubs in the world (The End in London, Studio 80 in Amsterdam and a label residency at Fabric to name a few) and plays/played (some are now closed) regularly at the likes of Panoramabar, Robert Jonson, Trouw, Yellow and Labyrinth Festival. Will has contributed entries to two of the most respected commercially released mix series out there in DJ Kicks and Balance - both of which made it into Resident Advisors best 20 compilations of the year.

BIO:
Gioele Giacopelli as JWL is an Italian DJ and producer. He began to love music since he was only a kid, thanks to the domestic environment. His 360 degrees musical groundwork has been settled first by his parents (dad is a bass player and mum a great singer) who introduced him to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Pino Daniele and others from the 70’s and 80’s. When he started “walking with his own legs” and so creating a proper knowledge of different musical genres and artists, JWL discovered to have a big feeling for the Afro-American music culture (Soul, R’n’B, Funk, Jazz, Hip Hop, and so on) losing himself into the local hip hop scene. 2000 marks the first JWL's approach to the dance culture: he began to listen to some Masters At Work's productions and he was delighted about that sonority called House. Afterward, he bought his first console and started to collect vinyl records. In the following years, Gioele enriched his dance culture attending constantly at Red Zone Club in Perugia and it was fundamental for his growth. In 2005 he setted up his own studio and started producing music, gradually stepping in the Perugia underground scene, supported by various DJ's, among which Ricky L and Sauro Cosimetti. 2011 marks for JWL his first digital release of his track “Hot Love” on the American label ""Plus Plus"". In September of 2012 he remixed Double Beat's track ""The Sense Of Truth"", released on ""Soul Shift Music"". After that, he made a track called “The Whistle Track” released on “The Yellow Drumachine EP” (Adult Dance Music) and in February of 2013 he made a remix of Joy Lee and Speakdeep's track ""Geist"", out on “Mind Your Hate”. JWL’s remix of Joy Lee’s track “On The Road”, released in November 2013 on “Sexonwax”, has preceded the turning point in his career, his first vinyl release on the Umbria-based label “Fortezza Records” with a track called “Little Theme”. This track, belongs to a banging four tracker EP featuring artists such as Mass Prod and Rufus, Giovanni Ferretti and Speakdeep. This EP was supported by a lot of Italian and international artists, for instance Mister G and Boyd Jarvis. In June 2015, JWL signed another important vinyl release on the UK label “Phatway Traxx”. This EP named “The Disco Cuts EP”, was first in many charts and the JWL’s track “Again’n’Again, contained on the b-side, it was supported by big artists like Ben Ufo. In 2016, he became part of the Berlin-based label “Soundscapes Records/Escape Series” and signed a four tracker EP in collaboration with the Tuscany musician and producer “INNO”. This amazing EP will be released on vinyl in the next months. JWL has performed in many important clubs such as “KaterBlau” (Berlin), “Red Zone Club/B-Side” (Perugia), “Serendipity/Rec Room“ (Foligno), “DOT Club” and important festivals as “Collective”, “SoundOf”, “Terni Factory”, “Interleave” and so on.

In the ‘90s, Holder began producing his own tracks and released 12”s for a number of labels like Definitive, Stickmen, his own imprint DNH, and !K7 (which released his first two full-length albums One Night in the Disco, and Back On Track).  Furthermore, Holder released many of his productions through NRK Sound Division, including many of his biggest hits such as ""I Once Believed in U"", ""Trying to Find Myself"" and ”Da Sambafrique"", in addition to full-length efforts From Within, Underground Alternatives, and The Other Side. 

Upcoming in 2016, look out for numerous releases on his label DNH under both Holder’s own name, as well as his Trackheadz alias.  Nick has also recently launched his own radio show DEEP SECTION, which is broadcast every Wednesday night at 8-10pm EST on VIBE 105.5 in Toronto and online at www.vibe1055.com.

Jimpster Biography 

Taste-maker, label boss, producer, DJ, remixer. Jamie Odell wears many hats and wears them well.

Under his Jimpster alias, he has become one the most revered deep house producer/DJs operating on the scene today.  His esteemed labels Freerange and Delusions of Grandeur continue to help break incredible new music and equally impressive acts such as Detroit Swindle, Tornado Wallace and Session Victim.  From his UK base, Jimpster has inadvertently become a standard-bearer and custodian of the authentic house sound, and carries this flag to the four corners of the world.
 
As he puts it: ""House music has been my first love and passion since hearing 'Strings Of Life' for the first time at The Essex Barn in 1988 and I'm still inspired by the memories I have of that period when the whole electronic music scene was so fresh and exciting as well as being really broad and eclectic.  One minute we were listening to Lil Louis' 'The Story Continues' and the next, freaking out to 'Radio Babylon' by Meat Beat Manifesto.  Every track seemed to have its own strong identity and unique sound and I guess that ethos is something I try and carry through to my A&R for the labels.  Certainly as a producer I am still striving to produce that perfect house track which will stand the test of time in the same way that those early classics have.  The blueprint is simple: to inject life, depth, soul, sincerity and attitude. This is what sets the players apart from the pretenders.  That challenge is what keeps me focused and inspired 25 years on and I'm sure it will keep me on my toes for the years to come.""
 
His seminal LP 'Messages From The Hub' established Jimpster as an artist of note back in the late 90’s and the music has flowed steadily and consistently since then, mostly on Freerange, with the 2006 excursion 'Square Up' on Ben Watt’s Buzzin Fly label proving to be a (temporary) transfer of one London-based deep house icon to another.
 
Releases such as 'Dangly Panther', 'A Love Like This' and 'Can't Stop Loving' continue to be choice cuts for many DJ's whilst 'These Times' and 'Porchlight And Rocking Chairs', two more recent deep house anthems, were remixed by Dixon and KiNK to serious effect.  2015 shows absolutely no signs of slowing down with the 'English Rose' EP arriving on Freerange in early summer and a new hook-up with Berlin’s Suol label kicking off with a remix of Till Von Sein’s 'Booty Angel'.  It continues with the Jimpster original 'Last Days of Summer' which is due mid summer.
 
Sterjimp? His current stat count as a remixer is touching a century and the acts to receive his midas touch includes everyone from Osunlade (“Mommas Groove” still being hammered by Moodymann on a regular basis), Solomun, Kollektiv Turmstrasse and Josh Wink ('Jus Right' stole the show at Dixon's 2015 Detroit Movement set) through to Bob Marley, Seal and Terrence Parker.  Recent remixes for Detroit Swindle, Paxton Fettel and Da Posse all show that the inspiration is still flowing thick and fast.

As we head deeper into 2015, with Jimpster still doing the business at globally renowned hotspots like Fabric, Air and Watergate, a slew of new music on the way, the ideas flowing freely and with over two decades of experience to draw on we see clearly that the fire is still burning as brightly as ever.

Since near 25 years, Loulou and Pollux are LuLúxpo: an inseparable and singular couple that looks like two characters who escaped from an interstellar comic-strip. LuLúxpo is therefore a fusion of two multidisciplinary artists. The duo of contemporary visual artists is influenced by pop-art and fashion. Together, they perform as electro DJs who have fallen from the sky and set fire to every dance floor they attend to. Their “four hands” sets are always memorable. Their motto: Love is Power!

Launched in January 2007 on Couleur3/RTS (Swiss national radio), LuLúxpo has its own radio show called Let’s Dance. It now airs on Radio Meuh (www.radiomeuh.com) since september 2017. 

Still in 2017, they launched their own record label: @ParadiseChildrenRecords: https://paradisechildrenrecords.bandcamp.com/.

Depuis plus de 20 ans, unis à la scène comme à la ville, inséparables et singuliers comme des personnages échappés d'un comic-strip interstellaire, Loulou et Pollux sont LuLúxpo: un couple fusionnel d'artistes pluridisciplinaires, duo de plasticiens contemporains au look flashy flirtant tour à tour avec le pop-art et la mode et un team-siamois de DJs électro tombés du ciel et mettant le feu aux dancefloors à chacune de leurs apparitions lors de sets mémorables ‘’à 4 mains’’. 
Leur leitmotiv: Love is Power! 

En janvier 2007 sur Couleur3/RTS (Swiss national radio), le couple donne naissance à Let's Dance, une émission de radio 100% Pink Electro.  Cette émission vogue depuis septembre 2017 sur les ondes de Radio Meuh (www.radiomeuh.com).

He started on the wheels of steel at the age of nine, and certainly made a contribution on the House scene in Chicago. He performed with some of Chicago’s luminaries, such as Armando, Ron Carroll, Boo Williams, Paul Johnson, Andre Harris, Mark Grant, and Glenn Underground, just to name a few. Inspired by Chicago’s definition of House, he accumulated his own unique style. DJ Fritz can move the crowd in more ways than one, as he strives to make more and more music. DJ Fritz has consistently played at some of Chicago’s infamous old and new school underground clubs. Having been a part of the House scene for over two decades, DJ Fritz has mastered the art of DJ’ing locally and internationally. 
As a producer, DJ Fritz produced his own tracks and remixed old school favorites like “Love You More” by Genuine, “New Day” by Patti LaBelle, and “O” by Omarion. In 2000, DJ Fritz created Muzic Vision Records with DJ Papa, with the following mission: to create, produce, remix, and play unique music that combines jazz, gospel, house, lounge, and other soulful qualities. With this in mind, Muzic Vision Records released “African Orchestra,” “Brighter Day,” and “The Journey Home” with last releases from Glenn Underground titled “Inner Techno” and “Ambient Jazz 1.” Muzic Vision Records established itself, and DJ Fritz continued to work on projects, and spinning at major nightclubs. He then moved on and collaborated with DJ Pap to form Naked Soul, which released nothing but soulful grooves. Later, more entities were created, such as Black Mamba, which is their African tribal grooves, and Gamma Kids, where you will hear more of the techno beats. 
DJ Fritz’s music, producing, and remixing styles reflect the deep sounds of the soulful House in Chicago. He has a number of singles and EPs supported by Citrus Recording and Cameo Recording in the UK, Lad Records in Portugal, United Music Records in France, Music Plan Records in Italy, and his own label, Muzic Vision Records. DJ Fritz creates and produces sounds that blur the lines between genres and connect the dots for his listeners. He is still highly involved within the House scene in Chicago and is currently, working on several tracks, which will soon be released. Through creativity, ingenuity, and a genuine message, DJ Fritz and Muzic Vision Records will continue to take music to a higher standard throughout the world.

Nestling somewhere between the sideways slant of a sepia Sunday morning and the electrostatic seduction of a Saturday night, Tim has carved out a cultural niche that is his, and his alone. His original productions range from the jaw-droppingly original (It’s a Fine Line – Woman), to the heartbreakingly sublime (Tim Paris – Outback, Stones & Vinyl), and his remixes (the XX; Silicone Soul; Salif Keita; Telepop Musik) reflect his unique musical position.  Tim’s label, Marketing Music, has quietly gone about releasing some of the most innovative and gloriously confounding electronic house music of the past decade, and his collaboration with ex Black Strobe bohemian Ivan Smagghe, It’s a Fine Line, has borne fruit, after juicy fruit. Dancers, his first full-length release, was signed by Canadian label My Favorite Robot and is an astonishing piece of work. Switching effortlessly from metallic electro purring, to slack-jawed new-wave disco, to shimmering, bewitching, house, it marks a new high point in a career rammed full of them.	8743	251	0	156	71	10	2021-10-20T07:55:50Z	2007-12-12T08:09:13Z	False

From the outset, his early productions on Hypercolour UTTU and Ultramajic showed incredible depth and dance floor sensibilities, frequently mastering that difficult line between genres that producers seek, but often fall short of (and often sounding contrived when trying). His vinyl-only label series “Bodytrax” (which he proudly runs with the Clone.nl crew in Holland) is an ongoing outlet for these productions; one that ebbs and flows through his passion for creating what he feels like organically and not what’s being hyped at the time. Drawing on his years of experience as a DJ and not being one to settle simply for “getting the job done”, his output is renowned for being incredibly effective and standing out in the sets of DJs the world over, with his music consistently featured on Radio 1 shows and essential mixes. In 2016, he dropped his critically “Cobra Effect EP” on DEXT which was championed by the likes of Black Madonna and Jackmaster, which led to an invitation by legendary pioneers Leftfield to remix ""Song Of Life"" on their historic 22 Year Anniversary re-release of “Leftism” in 2017. He also explored collaborations including “Hotshot” with long-time supporter Paul Woolford aka Special Request, and his new “Duel Series” which kicked off in late 2019 with Berlin legend Fiedel.

On the performance side, his early days saw him as a DMC DJ Championship competitor, and then cutting his teeth worldwide as a techno DJ (including a residency at the UK's largest and most respected parties “Atomic Jam” in Birmingham). His lifelong obsession with seeking out and collecting music has also paid off in spades in the form of his vast record collection, which he explores with mixes and shows he has produced for the likes of Radio 1, FACT, Mixmag, DJ Mag, and Rinse FM. Armed with these experiences and credentials, he is known as a technically skilled and incredibly intuitive DJ, taking risks where they count and never playing the same set twice. Tapping into his love affair with music and working the floor, he prides himself in being able to play pretty much anywhere, be it techno, electro & EBM in the main rooms of Berghain or Fabric, jacking Chicago and acid house alongside the originators in the “Dancemania Mixmag Lab”, or electronica & beyond supporting Leftfield on their Leftism 22 UK arena UK arena tour in 2017.

These were the years of the “new wave” / “electro funk” / “garage” / “house” of the 90s, and Alex quickly became well known across the leading clubs across the globe.
Alongside his DJing successes, he melted efforts with his business partner Marco Baroni to build the brand Kamasutra with releases that were felt on a global scale.
In 1999 Planet Funk were born and with their first single “Chase the Sun” they emerged at the top of global charts, and subsequently various albums and singles of equal success and industry acclaim. The band has released a total of 5 albums plus a “Best Of” and is currently releasing its sixth album.
Alex Neri has collaborated with the notable Tenax Club in Florence in starting the record label “Tenax Recordings”, acclaimed both by the public and the music industry. The first single, “Housetrack”, released in 2004 won the Siae prize for being the most sold album from an independent label.
Tenax Recordings has showcased a myriad of well known DJs and Italian producers like Federico Grazzini, Ilario Alicante, Luca Bacchetti, Philipp&Cole and many more.
While Alex continues to produce, he also works on various remixing projects for many international and local artists.
At the very core, Alex’s passion remains the club, where he can best express his pure love for music.
